Integrating own files into fimware
----------------------------------

That is really simple: Copy your files to the ./root/ folder where ever you want
the files to be in the firmware root filesystem (except ./root/lib/ and
./root/usr/lib/ which are treated seperatly). e.g a file ./root/usr/bin/foo will
be at /usr/bin/foo on the box.
