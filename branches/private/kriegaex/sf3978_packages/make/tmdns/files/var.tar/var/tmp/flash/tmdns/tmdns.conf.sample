# If you leave this empty, tmdns will announce the name from the system config

# the advertised name.
# Note that only the part up to the first dot (if any) is used as hostname.

# param service_file

# You can advertise services running on your machine in a static service
# definition file. This will allow other machines on your network to discover
# and use those services.

# Some distributions may support automatic service registration in the services
# 'init' scripts, in which case you can leave this setting (and the file) alone.

# Default : 7200

# param unicast_ttl

# to cache our responses for too much time.

# Default : 10

# param dns_bridge 
#
# When set to true, dns unicast queries from the localhost will be.
# forwarded as multicast queries to the local net. Multiple answers
# will be gathered and passed back to the calling process as one
# unicast dns answer.
#
# Default : yes
#

# param allow_nonlocal 
#
# When set to true, dns unicast queries for names and addresses that
# are not in the ".local." zone are forwarded to the multicast group.
# This is insecure and also would require a unicast DNS server that 
# can answer such a question.
# When set to "no", such a query will be answered with "SERVFAIL"
# what in turn should make your resolver ask the next DNS server in
# your resolver conf.
#
# Default : no
#
allow_nonlocal = no

# param local_domains 
#
# If you have set "allow_nonlocal" to "no", you may want additional names
# to be queried by multicast dns, maybe because you also use one of the private
# network address ranges in your network. 
# With this parameter, you can specify which domain suffixes also should be
# searched by mDNS requests.
# This parameter only has some effect when "dns_bridge" is set to "yes"
# and "allow_nonlocal" is set to "no".
# 
# Example: 
#   To allow to lookup the 192.168.9.0/24 network, add "9.168.192.in-addr.arpa"
#   to the list.
# 
# Note that you can not use both, unicast AND multicast DNS for the same domain.
# Do not use this parameter if there is a real DNS for a domain and that nameserver
# does not support multicast dns.
# 
#
# Default :  .local .254.169.in-addr.arpa .0.8.e.f.ip6.arpa
#
local_domains =  .local .254.169.in-addr.arpa .0.8.e.f.ip6.arpa

# param dns_port 
#
# When dns_bridge above is enabled, on which port should tmdns listen
# for unicast dns messages.
# You may want to change this if you have another dns server running
# on your machine and want to forward the ".local." domain to tmdns.
#
# Default : 53

# param gather_delay 
#
# number of seconds to delay unicast dns answers to allow more answers
# to be gatered. Do not set this to something more then about 4 sec.
# Only relevant if you also enabled dns_bridge above.

# Default : 2

# param dynamic_service_file 
#
# In addition to the above 'service_file', there is a second file that will
# be modified by the 'register-service' utility. You should not change this
# setting until you know what you're doing. If you like to change it here, 
# anyway, you also need to modify the 'register-serviceï¿½ script to
# reflect the new path.
# 
# You have been warned !

# Default : /var/run/tmdns.services

# param exclude_interfaces 
#
# By default, tmdns accepts and sends multicast DNS packets on all network
# interfaces.
# 
# It may be sensible to exclude some interfaces, for example the external
# interface of an internet router.
# 
# Remember, that mDNS may give away some usefull informations to someone
# who want to attack your system.
# 
#
# Default :
