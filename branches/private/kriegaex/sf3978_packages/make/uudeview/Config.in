		  UUDeview is a program that helps you transmit and receive binary files over
		  the Internet, using electronic mail or newsgroups The UUDeview package includes
		  both an encoder and a decoder. The decoder automatically detects the type of
		  encoding used, offering MIME's Base64 and BinHex as well as the popular uuencoding
		  and the less frequently used xxencoding methods. Recently, support for the popular
		  yEnc encoding was also added. The encoder runs the other way around and encodes a
		  binary file for sending it by mail or news.
