		This project tunnels TCP data through a UDP tunnel. The executable can act as
		the server or client. The server acts as a proxy for the client, listening
		on a specified UDP port and creating a connection to a TCP server that the
		client specifies. The client listens on a TCP port, acting as the server that
		some TCP client connects to. The client recevies any TCP data on that port 
		and sends the data to the udpserver, which sends it to the TCP connection it
		made with the desired TCP server.
