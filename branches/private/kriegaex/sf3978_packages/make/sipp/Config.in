		SIPp is a free Open Source test tool / traffic generator for the SIP protocol.
		It includes a few basic SipStone user agent scenarios (UAC and UAS) and
		establishes and releases multiple calls with the INVITE and BYE methods. It can
		also reads custom XML scenario files describing from very simple to complex call
		flows. It features the dynamic display of statistics about running tests (call
		rate, round trip delay, and message statistics), periodic CSV statistics dumps,
		TCP and UDP over multiple sockets or multiplexed with retransmission management
		and dynamically adjustable call rates.
		Other advanced features include support of IPv6, TLS, SIP authentication, conditional
		scenarios, UDP retransmissions, error robustness (call timeout, protocol defense), call
		specific variable, Posix regular expression to extract and re-inject any protocol
		fields, custom actions (log, system command exec, call stop) on message receive, field
		injection from external CSV file to emulate live users.
		SIPp can also send media (RTP) traffic through RTP echo and RTP / pcap replay. Media
		can be audio or audio+video.
		While optimized for traffic, stress and performance testing, SIPp can be used to run
		one single call and exit, providing a passed/failed verdict.
		Last, but not least, SIPp has a comprehensive documentation available both in HTML and
		PDF format.
		SIPp can be used to test many real SIP equipements like SIP proxies, B2BUAs, SIP media
		servers, SIP/x gateways, SIP PBX, ... It is also very useful to emulate thousands of
		user agents calling your SIP system.
