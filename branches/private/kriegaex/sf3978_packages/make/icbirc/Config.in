		icbirc is a proxy that allows to connect an IRC client to an ICB server.
		The proxy accepts client connections, connects to the server, and for-
		wards data between those two connections.
		Commands from the IRC client are translated to ICB commands and forwarded
		to the ICB server. Messages from the ICB server are translated to IRC
		messages and forwarded to the IRC client.
		ICB (Internet citizen's band) an obscure teleconferencing system used
		primarily by alumni of certain universities (also called Internet CB or
		International CB).
		IRC (Internet Relay Chat) and ICB (Internet Citizen's Band) are two sepa-
		rate chat protocols.  ICB is an older and simpler protocol, basically a
		subset of IRC.  The two most significant differences (from the client's
		perspective) are:
		An ICB client can only join a single channel (called group).  Joining a
		second channel automatically parts the first channel.
		An ICB channel can only have a single operator (called moderator). Giv-
		ing operator status to a second client automatically removes operator
		status from the first client.
