		adsuck is a small DNS server that spoofs blacklisted addresses and forwards all
		other queries. The idea is to be able to prevent connections to undesirable
		sites such as ad servers, crawlers, etc. It can be used locally, for the road
		warrior, or on the network perimeter in order to protect local machines from
		malicious sites.
