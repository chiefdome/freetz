		Dropbear SSH server and client

		Dropbear is a relatively small SSH 2 server and client. It runs on a
		variety of POSIX-based platforms. Dropbear is open source software,
		distributed under a MIT-style license. Dropbear is particularly useful
		for "embedded"-type Linux (or other Unix) systems, such as wireless
		routers.

		Features
		  - A small memory footprint suitable for memory-constrained
		    environments - Dropbear can compile to a 110kB statically linked
		    binary with uClibc on x86 (only minimal options selected)
		  - Dropbear server implements X11 forwarding, and authentication-agent
		    forwarding for OpenSSH clients
		  - Can run from inetd or standalone
		  - Compatible with OpenSSH ~/.ssh/authorized_keys public key
		    authentication
		  - The server, client, keygen, and key converter can be compiled into a
		    single binary (a la busybox)
		  - Features can easily be disabled when compiling to save space
		    TCP forwarding support
