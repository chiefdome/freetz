		Netperf is a benchmark that can be used to measure the
		performance of many different types of networking. It
		provides tests for both unidirecitonal throughput, and
		end-to-end latency. The environments currently measureable
		by netperf include:
		  * TCP and UDP via BSD Sockets for both IPv4 and IPv6
		  * DLPI
		  * Unix Domain Sockets
		  * SCTP for both IPv4 and IPv6
