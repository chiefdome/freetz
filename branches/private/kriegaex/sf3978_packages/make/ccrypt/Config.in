		  ccrypt is a utility for encrypting and decrypting files and streams.
		  It was designed as a replacement for the standard unix crypt utility,
		  which is notorious for using a very weak encryption algorithm. ccrypt
		  is based on the Rijndael cipher. This cipher is believed to provide
		  very strong security.
