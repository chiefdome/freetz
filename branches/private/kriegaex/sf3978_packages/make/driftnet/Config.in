		Driftnet is a program which listens to network traffic and picks out
		images from TCP streams it observes. Fun to run on a host which sees
		lots of web traffic.  Obviously, driftnet is an invasion of privacy
		of a fairly blatant sort. Also, if you are possessed of Victorian
		sensibilities, and share an unswitched network with others who are
		not, you should probably not use it.
