		  LFT, short for Layer Four Traceroute, is a sort of 'traceroute' that often
		  works much faster (than the commonly-used Van Jacobson method) and goes
		  through many configurations of packet-filters (firewalls). More importantly,
		  LFT implements numerous other features including AS number lookups through
		  several reliable sources, loose source routing, netblock name lookups, et al.
		  What makes LFT unique? LFT is the all-in-one traceroute tool because it can
		  launch a variety of different probes using ICMP, UDP, and TCP protocols, or
		  the RFC1393 trace method. For example, rather than only launching UDP probes
		  in an attempt to elicit ICMP "TTL exceeded" from hosts in the path, LFT can
		  send TCP SYN or FIN probes to target arbitrary services. Then, LFT listens for
		  "TTL exceeded" messages, TCP RST (reset), and various other interesting heuristics
		  from firewalls or other gateways in the path. LFT also distinguishes between
		  TCP-based protocols (source and destination), which make its statistics slightly
		  more realistic, and gives a savvy user the ability to trace protocol routes, not
		  just layer-3 (IP) hops. With LFT's verbose output, much can be discovered about
		  a target network. WhoB is a likable whois client (see whois(1)) designed to provide
		  everything a network engineer needs to know about a routed IP address by typing
		  one line and reading one line.
		  LFT and WhoB are released under the open source license.
