		VGP (Virtual Gateway Protocol) is a very simple protocol able to 
	        work in a way similar to Cisco(c) HSRP. It implements the idea 
	        of Virtual Gateway to provide fault tollerance (and load 
	        balancing) on your net. Each client on your net has as its 
	        default gateway set to the virtual gateway and not the real router.
