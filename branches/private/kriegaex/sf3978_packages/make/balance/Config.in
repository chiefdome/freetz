		Balance is a load balancing solution being a simple
		but powerful generic tcp proxy with round robin load
		balancing and failover mechanisms. Its behaviour can
		be controlled at runtime using a simple command line syntax.
		Balance supports IPv6 on the listening side which makes it
		a very useful tool for IPv6 migration of IPv4 only services
		and servers. Balance successfully runs at least on Linux(386),
		Linux(Itanium), FreeBSD, BSD/OS, Solaris, Cygwin, Mac-OS X,
		HP-UX and many more. Balance is Open Source Software and
		released under GPL licensing terms.
