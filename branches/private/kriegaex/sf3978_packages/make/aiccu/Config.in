		AICCU (Automatic IPv6 Connectivity Client Utility) makes it easy for users to
		get IPv6 connectivity. After having requested an account, tunnel and optionally
		a subnet, AICCU can be used to automatically configure the tunnel.

		AICCU supports TIC (Tunnel Information & Control protocol), which it uses for
		retrieving the tunnel configuration information, AYIYA, which allows tunnels to
		be created even behind firewalls and NAT's.

		For more details see <http://www.sixxs.net/tools/aiccu/>.

		NOTE: Freetz builds its aiccu package without GnuTLS support!
		(See make/aiccu/patches/100-disable-gnutls.patch)
