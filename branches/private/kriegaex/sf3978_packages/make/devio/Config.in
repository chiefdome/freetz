		A command line program to correctly read (or write) a region
		of a block device. Primary use is for extracting formatted
		data from MTD partitions. The primary difference between devio
		and other command line utilities, such as dd and cat, is that
		it is not stream based - it writes directly into the object
		rather than reading and writing a stream of data.
