		transocksev is a transparent socks proxy, inspired by the idea of
		transocks (http://transocks.sourceforge.net).
		In some cases you might redirect TCP/IP-Traffic on your network-router
		trough a transparent SOCKS-Proxy. tranSOCKS_ev is a user-space daemon for
		linux that does this job perfectly based on iptable-filter-rules.
