		The EnergyMech is a fully functional IRC bot, written entirely
		in the C programming language. It has common features such as
		userlists, shitlists, channel protection, DCC partyline, botnet
		and lots more.
		The EnergyMech started out as a hack of the combot but is today
		quite different and more sophisticated. One of the main ideas of
		the EnergyMech is that it should be easy both to setup and use.
		The popular eggdrop requires that TCL is installed on a system
		for it to compile sucessfully, the EnergyMech has no such
		requirements. A person that is familiar with UNIX would have no
		trouble installing an EnergyMech and getting it up and running.
