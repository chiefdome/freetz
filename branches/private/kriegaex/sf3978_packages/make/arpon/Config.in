		ArpON (Arp handler inspectiON) is a portable handler daemon that
		make ARP secure in order to avoid the Man In The Middle through
		ARP Spoofing/Poisoning. Detects/blocks the DNS, WEB Spoofing,
		Session Hijacking, SSL/TLS Hijacking & co attacks.
		  Features:
		    * Proactive based solution for:
		      Point to point, Multipoint
		    * Support for networks:
		      Statically, Dinamically (DHCP), Hybrid network that is statically
		      and dinamically
		    * Blocks the Man In The Middle (MITM) attack through:
		      ARP Spoofing, ARP Cache Poisoning, ARP Poison Routing (APR)
		    * Three kinds of anti ARP Spoofing tecniques:
		      SARPI or Static ARP Inspection, DARPI or Dynamic ARP Inspection,
		      HARPI or Hybrid ARP Inspection
		    * Blocks the derived attacks:
		      Sniffing, Hijacking, Injection, Filtering & co attacks
		    * Blocks the complex derived attacks:
		      DNS Spoofing, WEB Spoofing, Session Hijacking, SSL/TLS Hijacking
		      & co attacks
		    * Support of Gratuitous ARP request and reply for:
		      Failover Cluster, Cluster with load-balancing, High-Availability
		      (HA) Cluster
		    * Manages the network interface with:
		      Unplug iface, Boot OS, Hibernation OS, Suspension OS
		    * Retro compatible with:
		      Classic ARP standard base protocol by IETF
		    * Tested against:
		      Ettercap, Cain & Abel, DSniff, Yersinia, scapy, arpspoof, netcut,
