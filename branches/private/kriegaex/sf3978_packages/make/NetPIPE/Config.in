		NetPIPE is a protocol independent performance tool that visually
	        represents the network performance under a variety of conditions. It
	        performs simple ping-pong tests, bouncing messages of increasing size
	        between two processes, whether across a network or within an SMP
	        system. Message sizes are chosen at regular intervals, and with slight
	        perturbations, to provide a complete test of the communication system.
	        Each data point involves many ping-pong tests to provide an accurate
	        timing. Latencies are calculated by dividing the round trip time in
	        half for small messages ( < 64 Bytes ).
