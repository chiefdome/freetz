		arpd replies to any ARP request for an IP address
		matching the specified destination net with the
		hardware MAC address of the specified interface,
		but only after determining if another host already
		claims it. Any IP address claimed by arpd is eventually
		forgotten after a period of inactivity or after a hard
		timeout, and is relinquished if the real owner shows up.
		This enables a single host to claim all unassigned
		addresses on a LAN for network monitoring or simulation.
