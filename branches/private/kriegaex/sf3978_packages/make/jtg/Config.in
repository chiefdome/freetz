		The JTG generator is a simple, yet powerful and, if required, accurate
	        traffic generator. jtg differs from other traffic generators in that one
	        instance of a jtg process only sends one stream (e.g. MGEN can send tens
	        of streams) and the characteristics of the stream are given only with
	        command line arguments. On the other hand, a receiving jtg process can
	        be set to loop and receive several streams but, again, only one at a
	        time. The received packets can be logged and the log files can be
	        analyzed with jtg_calc (see later in this file for instructions). jtg6
	        is the binary for IPv6 networks.
