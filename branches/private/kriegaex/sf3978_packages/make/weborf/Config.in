		  Weborf is a lightweight webserver designed to rapidly share directories.
		  Weborf uses the thread pool pattern to handle his threads. When it starts
		  it creates a first group of thread, and they will serve incoming connections
		  without terminating. If there are more connections than threads, a second
		  group of thread is created. And so onâ€¦ When the hi-traffic situation is over,
		  it will slowly terminate existing threads, to free memory. If the number of
		  threads reaches the limit, new incoming connections will be dropped.
		  Weborf is also able to execute scripts. It is also possible to use script to
		  perform authentication. Weborf can be used to let clients surf a site. It is
		  possible to start it quickly, with no need of being superuser. So it is often
		  a good choice to share a directory with other people without needing a
		  particular client. Weborf supports both IPv4 and IPv6. Works on POSIX compliant
		  systems, Weborf is written in C. Supports basic authentication, but doesn't implement
		  completely the http specification. Can be used to easily share directories,
		  since it's basedir can be set using directly the command line. Allows the execution
		  of server-side cgi scripts and implements the thread-pool pattern to reuse it's
		  threads. Works on GNU/Linux and MacOsX. Has a partial support for webdav.
