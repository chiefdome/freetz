		GNU Midnight Commander (MC) is probably the best known Norton Commander
		clone for free operating systems and definitely one of the most
		powerful. If you are looking for something smaller, feel free to give
		Deco a try, but don't expect as much comfort and power there as you
		will get here.

config FREETZ_PACKAGE_MC_INTERNAL_EDITOR
	bool "Internal editor"
	depends on FREETZ_PACKAGE_MC
	default y
	help
		MC features an internal editor which can be started by F4. If you
		decativate it because you want to use vi or nano instead, F4 will
		still work. By default, vi is called on the box, but exporting EDITOR
		so it points to another editor of your choice will get you the
		combination of file manager and editor you desire.

		Switching off this feature saves about 95 KB in the main binary.

config FREETZ_PACKAGE_MC_SUBSHELL
	bool "Subshell support"
	depends on FREETZ_PACKAGE_MC
	select FREETZ_PACKAGE_BASH
	default n

		MC subshell support (~15 KB + bash).

config FREETZ_PACKAGE_MC_VFS
	bool "Virtual filesystem support (VFS)"
	depends on FREETZ_PACKAGE_MC
	default n
	help
		With VFS mc is able to browse compressed archives. Bear in mind that
		the archives are extracted to RAM!

		Virtual filesystem support adds about 100 KB.

config FREETZ_PACKAGE_MC_ONLINE_HELP
	bool "Online help"
	depends on FREETZ_PACKAGE_MC
	default y
	help
		MC comes with an online help file which can be viewed via 'F1'.

		Switching off this feature saves about 115 KB in the file system.

	bool "Use ncurses library instead of internal mcslang"
	depends on FREETZ_PACKAGE_MC
	select FREETZ_LIB_libncurses
	default n
	help
		If mc is linked against libncurses (200 KB) the size of the mc binary
		is reduced by about 50 KB, but if you do not need libncurses for any
		other package, those 50 KB are a good investment in order to remove
		libncurses from the firmware image and save (200 - 50) KB = 150 KB.

config FREETZ_PACKAGE_MC_FORCE_GLIB12
	bool "Use glib-1.2 instead of glib-2"
	depends on FREETZ_PACKAGE_MC
	select FREETZ_LIB_libglib_1
	default n
	help
		Activating this option forces mc to use the old glib-1.2 library.
		This was the default freetz behaviour until version 1.2.

		Activating the option might save space/RAM on "small" boxes.
		But if you already have some other package requiring glib-2
		it's probably better not to activate it.
