		ndyndns is a GPL'ed update client written in C that supports custom,
		static, and dynamic DNS. It avoids unnecessary updates, reports errors,
		logs to syslog, and generally ought to be compliant with everything
		required for a proper dyndns client. It is written to be secure and
		supports running as an unprivileged process in a chroot jail. SSL-encrypted
		transfers are also supported.
		ndyndns is dependent on cURL and currently works on Linux and the BSDs,
		but is easily portable to other POSIX platforms.
