		  uShare is a UPnP (TM) A/V & DLNA Media Server. It implements the server
		  component that provides UPnP media devices with information on available
		  multimedia files. uShare uses the built-in http server of libupnp to stream
		  the files to clients. GeeXboX uShare is able to provide access to both
		  images, videos, music or playlists files (see below for a complete file
		  format support list). It does not act as an UPnP Media Adaptor and thus,
		  can't transcode streams to fit the client requirements. uShare is written
		  in C for the GeeXboX project. It is designed to provide access to multimedia
		  contents to GeeXboX but can of course be used by any other UPnP client device.
		  It should compile and run on any modern POSIX compatible system such as Linux.
		  uShare is free software - it is licensed under the terms of the GNU General
		  Public License (GPL).
