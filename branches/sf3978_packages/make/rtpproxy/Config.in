		  The Sippy RTPproxy is a high-performance software proxy server for
		  RTP streams that can work together with  SIP Express Router (SER),
		  OpenSIPS,  Kamailio, Sippy B2BUA or  reSIProcate B2BUA.
		  The main purpose of RTPproxy originally had been to make the
		  communication between SIP user agents behind NAT(s) (Network Address
		  Translator) possible. Several cases existed when direct end-to-end
		  communication is not possible and RTP streams have to be relayed
		  through another host. The RTPproxy can be used to setup such a relaying
		  host.
