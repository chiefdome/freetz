		  sshguard monitors servers from their logging activity. When logs convey
		  that someone is doing a Bad Thing, sshguard reacts by blocking he/she/it
		  for a bit. Sshguard has a touchy personality: when a naughty tyke insists
		  disturbing your host, it reacts firmer and firmer. sshguard supports many
		  services out of the box, recognizes several log formats, and can operate
		  many firewall systems. Many users appreciate its ease of use, compatibility
		  and feature richness.
