		Aeke is a light-weight, SSH-like program that uses an identity-based
		authentication protocol to guard against MITM attacks.
		Aeke consists of three distinct programs:
		aeked - the server. This is conceptually equivalent to sshd(8), but
		with a few important differences.
		aeke - the client program, conceptually equivalent to ssh(1). This
		is a commandline based program used to connect to an aeked server.
		aeke_cp - the copy program, similar to scp.
