		tcpscript is a tool that easily allows other people to see
		your terminal session screen in a way similar to the classic
		Unix command, "script". It opens a TCP port that allows
		anyone to connect to it using telnet and see in real time
		what you see on the terminal. For example, you can use "nano"
		in it as a blackboard or as a chat system.
