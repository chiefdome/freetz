		The STUN protocol (Simple Traversal of UDP through NATs) is
		described in the IETF RFC 3489, available at
		http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3489.txt. It's used to help clients
		behind NAT to tunnel incoming calls through. This server is the
		counterpart to help the client identify the NAT and have it open
		the proper ports for it.
