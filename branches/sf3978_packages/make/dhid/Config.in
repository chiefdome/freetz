		DHIS is a client-server based system architecture primarily meant for updating
		DNS for hosts that have dynamic IP addresses. With DHIS you can have your
		computer always recognised and available on the Internet with the same unique
		name, even if its IP address changes frequently.
		dhid is the DHIS client daemon. After setting up with the DHIS provider, each
		machine may run a dhid daemon (in background) in order to update its dynamic IP
		address within the server. Until release 4.0 DHIS was a system intended to
		provide dynamic DNS updates (on the server) only. In other words, the client
		daemon dhid would update its DNS entry within the server.
		Once running, dhid sends echo request packets to the server and expects a reply.
		Once received, dhid tries to authenticate at the server either in password or qrc
		mode. From then on, and providing authentication was successful, the client waits
		and replies to queries originated at the server. If the server doesn't receive
		acknowledgments of these packets the host is marked offline. Likewise, if the
		client doesn't receive queries for a period of time the offline stage is restored.
		Therefore, the only thing a DHIS host needs is to run the dhid client. The server
		is able to determine when the host is online and the server tables are updated
		automatically.
		From R5 the DHIS client dhid no longer implements mail relaying functions or
		interactive mode. This release of the client however supports the following
		additional features:

		    Multi-server support
		    Multi-client update support 
		    Configurable refresh rates
		    Possibility of running external commands when online/offline transitions occur.

		For an example of the possible options please see dhid.conf.sample
