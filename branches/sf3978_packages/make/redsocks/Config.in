		This tool allows you to redirect any TCP connection to SOCKS
		or HTTPS proxy using your firewall, so redirection is system-wide.
		Why is that useful? I can suggest following reasons:
		    * you use tor and don't want any TCP connection to leak
		    * you use DVB ISP and this ISP provides internet connectivity with
		      some special daemon that may be also called "Internet accelerator"
		      and this accelerator acts as proxy. Globax is example of such an
		      accelerator
		Linux/iptables, OpenBSD/pf and FreeBSD/ipfw are supported. Linux/iptables
		is well-tested, other implementations may have bugs, your bugreports are welcome.
		Features:
		Redirect any TCP connection to SOCKS4, SOCKS5 or HTTPS (HTTP/CONNECT) proxy server.
		Login/password authentication is supported for SOCKS5 connections. SOCKS4 supports
		only username, password is ignored. Redirect any HTTP connection to proxy that does
		not support transparent proxying (e.g. old SQUID had broken `acl myport' for such
		connections).
