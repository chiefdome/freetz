		A very simple "host" implementation by Patrik Lembke <blambi@chebab.com>
		It is not meant to be a full host replacement etc just translate hostname
		to a IP.  "This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or

		(at your option) any later version."
		Usage:
		  For a single host
		  $ bost host
		  For an IP address:
		  $ bost 10.0.0.1
		  or
		  $ bost 2001:6b0:17:f0a0::b3
		  For N hosts
		  $ bost host1 ... hostN
		  For a subnet/range
		  $ bost 192.168.0.0/24
		  Another range
		  $ bost 192.168.0.0/32
		current options are:
		  -h, --help     Show help
		  -d, --double   enable double check
		for example "bost -d foo" would output both the ip(s) of foo
		and the hostname(s) for the ip(s).
