		light download accelerator - console version
		Axel tries to accelerate the downloading process by using multiple connections
		for one file. It can also use multiple mirrors for one download. Axel tries
		to be as light as possible (25-30k in binary form), so it might be useful as a
		wget clone on byte-critical systems.
