		  Email is a program for the Unix environment that sends messages. You may
		  think that this has already been done, and it has, but not with the quality
		  and enhancements that email has! Have you ever wanted to send email from
		  the command line using your SMTP server instead of sendmail? Have you ever
		  wanted to send email without entering a confusing menu application and you
		  only wanted to push a few command line options to route your email to the
		  SMTP server of your choice? Did you want to encrypt that email with gpg
		  before it was sent but wanted the email client to do it for you? If you
		  answered yes to all of these questions, then email is for you. You can now
		  send email via the command line to remote SMTP servers. You can have it
		  encrypted to the recipient of your choice. This and many other possibilities
		  are easily implemented with email.
		  Email boasts a lot of other qualities as well.
		    * Email supports SMTP Authentication.
		    * Email makes it possible to send to multiple recipients and also CC and
		      BCC multiple recipients.
		    * You can use an address book that is in an easy to format method.
		    * You are also able to send attachments using a swift flick on the command
		      line to specifying multiple files.
		    * Personalized signature file with dynamic options.
		  Email makes it simple to implement in cron jobs. You can pipe data into email
		  and it will accept it as your message which will bypass opening your editor, and
		  mail it properly. Also, you can tell email to stay quiet and never display any
		  output (except for errors) when operating. This way you won't get those annoying
		  emails from cron jobs when your cron job did actually work correctly.
		  There are plenty of things email can do, but it's not going to do them until you
		  download it!
