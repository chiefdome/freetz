		bittwist is designed to complement tcpdump, which
		by itself has done a great job in capturing network
		traffic. bittwist can regenerate the captured traffic
		onto a live network (the packets are generated from
		tcpdump trace file, generating a .pcap file).
		bittwist also comes with a comprehensive trace file
		editor to allow to change the contents of a trace file
		on the fly. Generally, a packet generator is useful in
		simulating networking traffic or scenario, testing firewall,
		IDS, and IPS, and troubleshooting various network problems.
