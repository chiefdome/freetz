		Icecast is a streaming mp3 audio server.
		Icecast provides nearly all the functionality
		of the Shoutcast server. It will accept
		encoding streams from encoders like winamp, shout
		and ices. It can also add itself to a directory
		server such as our own icecast.linuxpower.org or
		Nullsoft's yp.shoutcast.com.
