		iptotal is yet another IP traffic monitor. It listens to a network interface in
		non-promiscuous mode, and measures IP bandwidth usage. After the specified
		number of seconds, the average throughput is printed at total, input and output
		usage.
		The utility can be used to measure bandwidth usage without the need for an SNMP
		daemon. Such a daemon is sometimes not wanted for security reasons or simply not
		available for the machine to be measured.
		In combination with a simple script and MRTG or rrdtool it can be used to
		present the measured data in graphical format e.g. through a web interface.
