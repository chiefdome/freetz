		The dnsproxy daemon is a proxy for DNS queries. It forwards these
		queries to two previously configured nameservers: one for authoritative
		queries and another for recursive queries. The received answers are
		sent back to the client unchanged. No local caching is done.
		Primary motivation for this project was the need to replace Bind
		servers with djbdns in an ISP environment. These servers get recursive
		queries from customers and authoritative queries from outside at the
		same IP address. Now it is possible to run dnscache and tinydns on
		the same machine with queries dispatched by dnsproxy.
		Other scenarios are firewalls where you want to proxy queries to the
		real servers in your DMZ. Or internal nameservers behind firewalls, or...
