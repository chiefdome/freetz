		UDPcast is a file transfer tool that can send data simultaneously
		to many destinations on a LAN. This can for instance be used to
		install entire classrooms of PC's at once. The advantage of UDPcast
		over using other methods (nfs, ftp, whatever) is that UDPcast uses
		Ethernet's multicast abilities: it won't take longer to install 15
		machines than it would to install just 2.
		UDPcast is released under the GPL 2.0 license. Parts of the code (fec.c)
		falls under a BSD-like license. The new boot loader contains cardmgr,
		which falls under the mozilla public license. All other included third-party
		software (busybox, dialog, lzop, udhcp, ...) falls under GPL (to the best
		of my knowledge. If you notice software falling under a different license,
		especially one with a BSD-like publicity clause, please notify me).
		UDPcast can be started from the included busybox boot image for OS
		installations, or from the command line when using it for other purposes.
		Udpcast may be booted from CD, floppy media, or via the network, by uding
		PXE or Etherboot. A configuration file (udpcfg.txt) may be included on
		these boot media in order to bypass the setup menu.
		There is an udpcast mailing list at udpcast@udpcast.linux.lu . Please send
		all bug reports to this list. Note: You must be subscribed to the list in
		order to be able to send comments. You may subscribe to the list by sending
		a message with 'subscribe' in its body or subject to udpcast-request@udpcast.linux.lu,
		or by visiting: https://udpcast.linux.lu/mailman/listinfo/udpcast
