		sslh accepts HTTPS, SSH and OpenVPN connections on the same port. This
		makes it possible to connect to an SSH server or an OpenVPN on port 443
		(e.g. from inside a corporate firewall, which almost never block port
		443) while still serving HTTPS on that port.
		sslh-select uses only one thread, which monitors all connections
		at once. It is more recent and less tested, but only incurs a 16 byte
		overhead per connection. Also, if it stops, you'll lose all connections,
		which means you can't upgrade it remotely. If you are going to use sslh
		for a "small" setup (less than a dozen ssh connections and a low-traffic
		https server) then sslh-fork (= sslh) is probably more suited for you.
