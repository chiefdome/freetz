		  Masqmail is a mail server designed for hosts that are not permanently
		  connected to the internet. It handles outgoing messages, i.e. those
		  that are to be sent over the non-permanent link (usually a ppp or slip
		  connection over a modem or ISDN adapter) specially and delivers them
		  only when explicitely told to do so. There is support for multiple
		  providers, it is possible to write different configurations for each
		  one. The configuration chosen is selected at delivery time, so that if
		  for example a delivery of a message failed while connected with
		  provider 1, it may be delivered when connected to provider 2. For each
		  provider another mail host (or none) can be specified.
		  *** HINT: The use of MasqMail is *strongly* discouraged if you have a
		  permanent connection to the internet without a firewall. First
		  because it does not have the ability to block relaying (it relays
		  every mail) and second because there are no capabilities to
		  protect against SPAM.
