Simple Setup
============

You want
--------

- submit mail on stdin by calling masqmail on the commandline
- submit mail with SMTP from the local machine
- let masqmail deliver mail locally to the system mailboxes /var/mail/*

You have luck, because this is what masqmail does by default.


Set up
------

Follow the description in INSTALL.

A common configure call would be:

    ./configure --enable-auth --enable-ident


Configuration
-------------

You just need a minimal config file, having one line:

    host_name = "foo.example.org"

(Substitute a real value, of course.)


Starting the daemon
-------------------

Listening for SMTP connections on a port requires masqmail to run as
daemon. You probably want to start masqmail as daemon each time the
system comes up. How you have to do that is system dependent.
/etc/rc.local is a good try to add the daemon call, because this file
seems to be frequently available.

    /usr/local/sbin/masqmail -bd -q10m

This starts masqmail in daemon mode and does a queue run every ten
minutes.


Check the setup
---------------

Ensure you have the sendmail links correct:

    $ ls -l /usr/lib/sendmail /usr/sbin/sendmail
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 25 2010-03-06 13:50 /usr/lib/sendmail -> /usr/local/sbin/masqmail*
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 25 2010-03-06 13:50 /usr/sbin/sendmail -> /usr/local/sbin/masqmail*

Send a mail to yourself:

    $ echo "some text" | mail `whoami`

Check if the mail was delivered (then delete it and quit):

    $  mail
    Mail version 8.1.2 01/15/2001.  Type ? for help.

    & q


In case of problems
-------------------

Have a look at the log file: /var/log/masqmail/masqmail.log

Set the debug level in masqmail.conf, restart the daemon, redo the
test, and look at the debug file: /var/log/masqmail/debug.log
