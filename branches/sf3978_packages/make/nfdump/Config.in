		 The nfdump tools collect and process netflow data on the command line:
		    NFDUMP tools overview:
		    All tools support netflow v5, v7 and v9.

		    - nfcapd - netflow capture daemon.
		    Reads the netflow data from the network and stores the data into files.
		    Automatically rotate files every n minutes. ( typically ever 5 min )
		    nfcapd reads netflow v5, v7 and v9 flows transparently. You need one
		    nfcapd process for each netflow stream.

		    - nfdump - netflow dump.
		    Reads the netflow data from the files stored by nfcapd. It's syntax is
		    similar to tcpdump. If you like tcpdump you will like nfdump. Displays
		    netflow data and can create lots of top N statistics of flows IP addresses,
		    ports etc ordered by whatever order you like.

		    - nfreplay - netflow replay
		    Reads the netflow data from the files stored by nfcapd and sends it over
		    the network to another host.
