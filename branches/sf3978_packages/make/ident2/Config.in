		This ident daemon runs as either a stand-alone
		daemon or as a child of inetd. Replies of your
		choice can be generated through a .ident file
		in the users home directory. A .noident will make
		it do an ident will not be conducted if the file
		is found in the users home directory.
		The server can also send random replies to all
		requests. This simplifies the problem of using
		IRC through a NATD network.
