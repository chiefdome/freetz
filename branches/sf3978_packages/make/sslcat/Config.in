		SSLCat is a simple Unix utility that reads and writes data
		across an SSL enable network connection. SSLCat accepts a
		hostname and optional port number (443 is used if none is
		specified) and attempts to form a SSLv2 connection to the
		specified host. If all goes well, data is read from stdin
		and sent across the encrypted connection, while incoming
		data from the encrypted connection is sent stdout.
