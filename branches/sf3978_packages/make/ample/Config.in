		ample is  an MP3 server that allows you to listen
		to your music that can be stored locally or remotely.
		It does not intend  to  support mixing, radio shows
		etc. It is just an easy way to listen to your MP3 files
		everywhere using the "open location" features already
		present in  XMMS, WinAmp  and  Media  Player.
