		GCC low-level runtime library

		GCC provides a low-level runtime library, `libgcc.a' or `libgcc_s.so.1'
		on some platforms. GCC generates calls to routines in this library
		automatically, whenever it needs to perform some operation that is too
		complicated to emit inline code for.

		Most of the routines in libgcc handle arithmetic operations that the
		target processor cannot perform directly. This includes integer multiply
		and divide on some machines, and all floating-point operations on other
		machines. libgcc also includes routines for exception handling, and a
		handful of miscellaneous operations.
