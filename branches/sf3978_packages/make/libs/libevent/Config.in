		libevent is an asynchronous event notification software library.

		The libevent API provides a mechanism to execute a callback function
		when a specific event occurs on a file descriptor or after a timeout
		has been reached. Furthermore, libevent also support callbacks due to
		signals or regular timeouts.

		libevent is meant to replace the event loop found in event-driven
		network servers. An application just needs to call event_dispatch() and
		then add or remove events dynamically without having to change the event
		loop.
