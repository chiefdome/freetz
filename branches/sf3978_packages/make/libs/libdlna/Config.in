		libdlna aims at being the reference open-source implementation of DLNA
		(Digital Living Network Alliance) standards. Its primary goal is to
		provide DLNA support to uShare, an embedded DLNA & UPnP A/V Media Server,
		but it will be used to build both DLNA servers and players in the long
		term.
