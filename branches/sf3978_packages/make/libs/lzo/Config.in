		LZO is a portable lossless data compression library written in ANSI C.
		It offers pretty fast compression and *very* fast decompression.
		Decompression requires no memory. In addition there are slower
		compression levels achieving a quite competitive compression ratio
		while still decompressing at this very high speed.
