		A C library for portable packet creation and injection.
		Libnet is an API to help with the construction and handling of network
		packets.  It provides a portable framework for low-level network
		packet writing and handling (use libnet in conjunction with libpcap and
		you can write some really cool stuff).  Libnet includes packet creation
		at the IP layer and at the link layer as well as a host of supplementary
		and complementary functionality.  Libnet is very handy with which to
		write network tools and network test code.  See the manpage and sample
		test code for more detailed information.
