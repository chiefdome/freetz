		autossh is a program to start a copy of ssh and monitor it, restarting
		it as necessary should it die or stop passing traffic.
		The original idea and the mechanism were from rstunnel (Reliable SSH
		Tunnel). With version 1.2 the method changed: autossh now uses ssh to
		construct a loop of ssh forwardings (one from local to remote, one
		from remote to local), and then sends test data that it expects to get
		back. (The idea is thanks to Terrence Martin.)
