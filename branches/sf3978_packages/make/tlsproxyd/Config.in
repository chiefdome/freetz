		tlsproxyd is a general proxying daemon for TLS/SSL. It allows you to connect
		TLS-enabled clients to non-TLS-enabled servers, presumably over a secure
		network so as not to miss the point entirely. It requires OpenSSL.
		It differs from stunnel, sslwrap etc. in that it is a stand alone daemon,
		rather than a program which runs from inetd. This is primarily so that it can
		conveniently be used with a certificate which has a pass phrase. Also, stunnel
		especially has a history of security holes; tlsproxyd is intended to be as
		simple as possible, so as to avoid any obvious pitfalls of this sort. (The
		third reason for writing it was to learn something about SSL; the take home
		message from this exercise is, `SSL: run screaming and don't look back'.
