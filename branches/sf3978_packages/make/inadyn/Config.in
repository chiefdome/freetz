		Inadyn is a simple and small DDNS client. By using a DDNS client
		such as inadyn you can register an Internet name at certain providers
		that the DDNS client updates, periodically and/or on demand when your IP
		changes. Inadyn can maintain MULTIPLE host NAMES with the SAME IP address,
		and has a WEB BASED IP DETECTION which RUNS well BEHIND a NAT router.
		Inadyn supports updating SEVERAL DDNS servers, SEVERAL ACCOUNTS even on
		DIFFERENT DDNS providers.

		Common DDNS service providers supported by inadyn:
		    http://www.dyndns.org

		    http://www.zoneedit.com
		    http://www.no-ip.com

		This is a fork of the original INADYN implementation from Narcis Ilisei. Most
		of the fixes and additions from the new "upstream" by Christoph Brill have been
		added. Excluding the GNU Autotools build system introduction, Windows platform
		fixes and a highly suspicious set of base64 API fixes from inadyn-advanced.
		However, this project is not a fork off of Christoph's repository, but rather a
		reengineered version of the original 1.96.2 release with all additional patches
		audited and merged separately. Additionally a further set of code cleanups,
		features and bug fixes have been added. The most interesting one, which no other
		Inadyn fork seems to have, is a fix to a rather nasty socket leak.
		The goal of this project is to entirely focus on *BSD, UN*X and various embedded
		Linux platforms. All sane patches addressing this target audience are welcome!
