		Yaa Ippd is an ipp(Internet Printing Protocol) server.
		It's small and fast. It is more suitable for embedded
		system. As now, it only supports Linux.
		Why use Yaa Ippd? 
		For the IPP is a protocol which is widely supported in
		most OSs, and it can be used on Internel with url.
		(P910nd doesn`t support this function.) As an
		application layer protocol, IPP has one of its designed
		goals, not to invent new security features when it can
		use existing protocols. 
		We know that CUPS supports ipp, and it is more powerful.
		Why not we use it? Because it is so powerful that it
		have so many functions that we don`t need. For most
		embedded system, we only need a printer server
		application, and the smaller the better.
		Features:
		1. Only use basic library. So, It can easily run in most
		    system.
		2. Support simultaneously printing works. And that only
		    uses one thread(also, one process). So, it doesn't
		    need a pthread library, and doesn't need CPU cost of
		    processes switching.
		3. Minimal memory cost.
		4. Minimal CPU cost.
		5. Support SSL.(On developing.)
		6. Support IPv6.(On developing.)
		7. Better architecture. Object-oriented code with C
