		arping is a utility to find out if a specific IP address
		on the LAN is 'taken' and what MAC address owns it.
		Sure, you could just use 'ping' to find out if it's
		taken and even if the computer blocks ping (and everything
		else) you still get an entry in your ARP cache. But what if
		you aren't on a routable net? Or the host blocks ping (all
		ICMP even)? Then you're screwed. Or you use arping.
		Broadcasts a who-has ARP packet on the network and prints
		answers. VERY useful when you are trying to pick an unused
		IP for a net that you don't yet have routing to.
