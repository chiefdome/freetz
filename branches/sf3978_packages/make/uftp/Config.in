		UFTP is a multicast file transfer program, utilizing a protocol
		based on Starburst MFTP. It is designed to reliably and efficiently
		transfer files to multiple receivers simultaneously, where either
		the intended receivers can be specified beforehand, or receivers
		can join the transfer when it is initiated. This is useful for
		distributing large files to a large number of receivers, and is
		especially useful for data distribution over a satellite link (with
		two way communication), where the inherent delay makes any TCP based
		communication terribly inefficient.
