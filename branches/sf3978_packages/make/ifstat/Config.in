		 ifstat is a tool to report network interfaces bandwith
		 just like vmstat/iostat do for other system counters.
		 ifstat gathers these statistics from the kernel internal
		 counters, which is highly operating system dependent.
		 If the net-snmp (or ucd-snmp) library is available,
		 ifstat can use it to gather statistics from remote equipments
		 (hosts, routers, switches...) or even the local host if a SNMP
		 daemon is running. ifstat's functionnalities can also be
		 included in a static library for use in other applications.
		 To use it, you just have to pass --enable-library while
		 configuring ifstat
