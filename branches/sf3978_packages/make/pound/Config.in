		The Pound program is a reverse proxy, load balancer
		and HTTPS front-end for Web server(s). Pound was
		developed to enable distributing the load among several
		Web-servers and to allow for a convenient SSL wrapper
		for those Web servers that do not offer it natively.
		Pound is distributed under the GPL - no warranty, it's
		free to use, copy and give away.
