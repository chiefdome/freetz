		tcpick is a textmode sniffer libpcap-based that can track, reassemble
		and reorder tcp streams. tcpick is able to save the captured flows in
		different files or displays them in the terminal, and so it is useful
		to sniff files that are transmitted via ftp or http. It can display all
		the stream on the terminal, when the connection is closed in different
		display modes like hexdump, hexdump + ascii, only printable charachters,
		raw mode and so on. Actually it can handle several interfaces, including
		ethernet cards and ppp. It is useful to	keep track of what users of a
		network are doing, and is usable with textmode tools like grep, sed, awk.
