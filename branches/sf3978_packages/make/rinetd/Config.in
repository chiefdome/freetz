		Rinetd redirects TCP connections from one IP address and port to another.
		Rinetd is a single-process server which handles any number of connections
		to the address/port pairs specified in the configuration.
		Since rinetd runs as a single process using nonblocking I/O, it is able to
		redirect a large number of connections without a severe impact on the
		machine.
