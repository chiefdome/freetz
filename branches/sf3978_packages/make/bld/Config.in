		BLD stands for "blacklist daemon" and is intended to serve a blacklist.
		The blacklist is built by simply inserting IP addresses or by using
		submission rate limits based on a maximum number of submissions of the
		same IP address within a minimum time interval. You can build a BLD cluster
		by configuring the daemon to notify other similar daemon(s) every time an
		IP address is added to the blacklist. BLD was primarily designed to fight
		against dictionary-based spams (by making the MTA report to BLD any host
		that tries to send a mail to an unknown user) but can be used by any program.
		As of now, it is highly recommended to USE IT IN A SAFE ENVIRONMENT: access
		control is based on clients IP addresses. This is why, by default, BLD binds
		to localhost and should not accept requests from a machine where non-trusted
		users can be logged in or establish network connections to via other means (PHP
		for example).
