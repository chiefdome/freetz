		nuttcp is a network performance measurement tool intended for
		use by network and system managers. Its most basic usage is to
		determine the raw TCP (or UDP) network layer throughput by
		transferring memory buffers from a source system across an
		interconnecting network to a destination system, either
		transferring data for a specified time interval, or alternatively
		transferring a specified number of bytes. In addition to reporting
		the achieved network throughput in Mbps, nuttcp also provides
		additional useful information related to the data transfer such as
		user, system, and wall-clock time, transmitter and receiver CPU
		utilization, and loss percentage (for UDP transfers).
