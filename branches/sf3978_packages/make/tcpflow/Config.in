		  tcpflow is a program that captures data transmitted as part of TCP connections
		  (flows), and stores the data in a way that is convenient for protocol analysis
		  or debugging. A program like 'tcpdump' shows a summary of packets seen on the
		  wire, but usually doesn't store the data that's actually being transmitted. In
		  contrast, tcpflow reconstructs the actual data streams and stores each flow in
		  a separate file for later analysis. tcpflow understands sequence numbers and
		  will correctly reconstruct data streams regardless of retransmissions or
		  out-of-order delivery. However, it currently does not understand IP fragments;
		  flows containing IP fragments will not be recorded properly. tcpflow is based
		  on the LBL Packet Capture Library (available from LBL) and therefore supports
		  the same rich filtering expressions that programs like 'tcpdump'  support. It
		  should compile under most popular versions of UNIX; see the INSTALL file for
		  details.
