		  TCPreen is a simple tool to monitor and analyze data transmitted between
		  clients and servers through connection-oriented streams data such as a
		  TCP sessions; it supports TCP over either IPv4 or IPv6. This tool focuses
		  on the data stream (software/socket layer), not on the lower level
		  transmission protocol as packet sniffers do. TCPreen listens on a TCP port
		  and wait for incoming connections to come in. Then, it forwards data sent
		  by the connecting client to another server port (possibly on another computer)
		  and forwards server responses back to the client. TCPreen can display data on
		  your console in real-time and/or save it to log files for later reference.
		  Various display formats are available. While it was originally meant to help
		  developers reverse-engineer TCP-based protocols, it can also be very useful
		  to debug network server or client software or for a system administrator to
		  monitor a TCP service.
