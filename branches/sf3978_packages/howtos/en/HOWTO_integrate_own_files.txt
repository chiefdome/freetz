Integrating own files into fimware
----------------------------------

Own files can be integrated into the firmware using the addon function. For
this purpose uncomment own-files-0.1 line in addon/static.pkg and copy the
files to addon/own-files-0.1/ to the desired place. Some example directories
are already there but others can be created for convenience.
