Installing addon packages
-------------------------

Packages that are not yet integrated into the mod can be installed as a so
called "addon package". Download the addon package and untar it into the ./addon
folder.

e.g.
tar -C addon -xjvf /path/to/addon_package-0.1-freetz.tar.bz2

Afterwards the package name has to be appended to the list ./addon/static.pkg as
a new line (example above: addon_package-0.1). Addon packages are startet after
the integrated packages in the order they appear in ./addon/static.pkg. The
command

make

updates the modified firmware image.

To avoid version conflicts, you should deselect the original package in the
"Package selection" section of

make menuconfig

if the addon is another version of a already ingetragted package.
