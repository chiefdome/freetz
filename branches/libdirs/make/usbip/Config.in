		USB/IP Project aims to develop a general USB
		device sharing system over IP network. To share
		USB devices between computers with their full
		functionality, USB/IP encapsulates "USB I/O messages"
		into IP packets and transmits them between computers.

		If you plan to share a printer with this package, consider
		to remove AVM's printserv, but not the usblp kernel module.

		This replaces AVM's printserv by a wrapper to
		automatically share connected printers.
