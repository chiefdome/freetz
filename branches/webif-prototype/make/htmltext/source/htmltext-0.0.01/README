htmltext-0.0.01 - allow scripts to read i18-messages from database

The package contains 2 small tools, createDB and getText, where the former
serves to compile a properties file into a binary database and the latter will
be used to read entries from that database.
createDB is intended to be run on PC systems, where as getText is intended to 
run on embedded systems.


Sourceformat for message database:
   Messages may be put into a textfile using the properties format, which means
   a key (5 characters) followed by ':' or '=' as separator, followed by the 
   message text:
      MSG01: this is a sample message
      MSG02=hello World


createDB:
   reads from a sorted properties file, checks the length of the keys and 
   creates a binary database useful for getText.

   usage:   sort < messages_en.properties > messages.sorted
            createDB -i messages.sorted -o htmltext.db


getText:
   gets a message from binary database, that matches given key. If the database
   does not contain the given key, the key will be returned as message.

   usage:   getText -d htmltext.db -k MSG02
