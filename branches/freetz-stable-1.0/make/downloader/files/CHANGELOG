**** Version 0.2 ***** 02.01.2008 *****

I. Eliminattion of known bugs

1. Download failed.   Status: fixed
downloader could download files only during first start of service.
Each additional start of downloader service was terminated with
"download failed".
Cause: Files could not be re-written during unzip stage.
Solution: chmod 777 and rm before unzip stage.

II. New features

1. Wait stage is moved from before to after ping-test. Files are
   downloaded faster now.
2. Special Downloader log /var/log/downloader.log can be activated
   if necessary. This log file can be shown and deleted, too.

   This option is very usefull before firmware update. Only downloaded
   files are removed during this operation.

   change. Password can be shown anymore by "display source code"
