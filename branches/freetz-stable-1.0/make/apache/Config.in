		Apache + PHP CGI

		You can either build a stand-alone Apache or an additional PHP CGI binary.
		Both applications can be found in packages/apache-x.y.z after the build, but
		will *NOT* be put into the firmware image automatically. This is because PHP
		is quite fat (3 MB) and better suited for external storage media. Apache is
		not as big ("only" around 550 KB) and might well fit into a firmware
		image, but this group of applications and their build files should be
		regarded as a technical playground for experts.

		The package directory contains a minimal directory structure for Apache + PHP,
		the latter of which can be found in 'cgi-bin' after the build. The config
		files might need adaption to your personal needs before you decide to either
		manually deploy the package on a USB disk or stick or copy them into the
		'root' directory so as to have them built into your firmware.

		You can also build PHP without Apache, but the CGI binary (sapi/cgi/php) will
		always be copied into the apache package directory. Should you need the CLI
		binary (sapi/cli/php), please get it yourself.

		Both packages, Apache and PHP, are linked against their needed libs
		dynamically by default, but you can change this by setting the corresponding
		switches. This will result in statically linked binaries without any exterior
		library dependencies. Choose whichever you prefer. The PHP switch works for
		both the CGI and CLI binaries.

		Should you need more special features like SSL for Apache, XML handling in
		PHP etc., please adapt the make files to your needs and look for tips, tricks
		and patches under http://www.ip-phone-forum.de/showthread.php?t=127089.

		The Apache httpd server
		  - is a powerful, flexible, HTTP/1.1 compliant web server 
		  - implements the latest protocols, including HTTP/1.1 (RFC2616)

		  - can be customised by writing 'modules' using the Apache module API 
		  - provides full source code and comes with an unrestrictive license 
		  - runs on Windows, Netware, OS/2, and most versions of Unix, as well as
		    several other operating systems 
		  - is actively being developed
