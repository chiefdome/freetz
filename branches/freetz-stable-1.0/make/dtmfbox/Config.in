		dtmfbox is a small softswitch application, that can be used to 
		control different tasks over telephone keyboard (via DTMF).
		The DTMF signals are handed over to a scriptfile.
		
		While scriptfile running, you can answer an incoming call, record
		or play a wave file, make another call, bridge calls, etc.
		
		The scriptfiles that are included in this package, contain an 
		answering machine, administration menu and a callback/callthrough 
		script.

		The application can also be configured as registrar, to allow 
		SIP client connects.
