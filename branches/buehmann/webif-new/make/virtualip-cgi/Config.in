		Creates a virtual network interface. In former times this was
		used to comfortably open server ports on the Fritz!Box itself
		via AVM web interface. Nowadays the avm-firewall package is used
		for this task.

		The package is also equipped with a configuration interface for the
		Freetz web configurator which lets you choose the IP address and
		net mask of the virtual interface as well as toggle auto-start.
