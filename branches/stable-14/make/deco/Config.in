	    Norton commander clone. Compared with Midnight Commander (mc) it is
	    considerably smaller, but also significantly less powerful and less
	    fancy-looking. Use it if you  want to trade power for file and memory
	    footprint, but still feel like requiring a file manager instead of a
	    plain UNIX shell.
