	    Lynx text mode web browser
	    
	    Lynx is a fully-featured World Wide Web (WWW) client for users running
	    cursor-addressable, character-cell display devices (e.g., vt100
	    terminals, vt100 emulators running on PCs or Macs, or any other
	    character-cell display). It will display HTML documents containing links
	    to files on the local system, as well as files on remote systems running
	    http, gopher, ftp, wais, nntp, finger, or cso/ph/qi servers, and
	    services accessible via logins to telnet, tn3270 or rlogin accounts.
