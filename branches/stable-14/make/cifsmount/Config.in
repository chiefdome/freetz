	    User space helper for mounting remote CIFS shares.
	    CIFS is an extended version of SMB, the well-known protocol used by
	    MS Windows and Samba for sharing folders, files and printers.
	    Thus, cifsmount is a replacement for smbmount, having the advantage
	    of being significantly smaller than smbmount. So if you want to mount
	    Windows or Samba shares from your router box, this package is for you.
