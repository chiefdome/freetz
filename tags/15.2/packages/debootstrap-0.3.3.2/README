How to build or update this package

The original version of this package consisted of a multi-stage build script
which first extracted and modified a Debian udeb package and then injected a
self-built binary. We decided to refrain from having a "Debian to DS-Mod
converter" in our build script in order to get a cleaner makefile
(debootstrap.mk) which only builds a binary and injects it into a prepared
package, as usual in DS-Mod. If you want to update the package, please read
the following description:

- Download debootstrap sources and Debian udeb package of the same version
  (0.3.3.2 at the time of writing this)
- Extract data.tar.gz (using 'ar' utility) from Debian udeb package
- Extract data.tar.gz to package/debootstrap-<version>/root
- Remove unwanted or unneeded scripts from extracted file structure (e.g.
  usr/lib/debootstrap/scripts/{breezy,hoary,warty,woody}
- Apply patches, if necessary (see below for a patch used in 0.3.3.2)
- Compile 'pkgdetails' binary using DS-Mod makefile and replace the invalid
  version extracted from the Debian udeb package
