		Streamripper records mp3 and ogg streams.
		For shoutcast style streams it finds the "meta data"
		or track separation data, and uses that as a marker
		for where the track should be separated.

		The streamripper binary without ogg/vorbis support adds
		122kB to the image. Additional space may be needed for
		shared libraries.

	help
		Select this option if you want to be able to rip
		ogg streams with streamripper.
		This will add 14kB to the main binary and up to
		225kB for the required ogg/vorbis shared libraries.
