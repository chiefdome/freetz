Restore original firmware
-------------------------

If your box is not accessible any more and your power LED is on while the other
LEDs are flashing up every few seconds, then the following instructions might
help to reanimate your box. In most cases mtd0 (filesystem) and mtd1 (kernel)
are affected and not mtd3 / mtd4 (NEVER touch mtd2).

1.) Your computer has to be in the same subnet like your box (and in the same
    broadcast domain): 192.168.178.0/24

2.) make recover

3.) Follow the instructions

The most comfortable way is not to clean the mod with `make clean',
`make dirclean' or `make distclean' and to keep the configuration after `make'.
In this case `make recover' will use the unmodified original firmware to recover
the device.

`make recover' uses a revised version of Enrik's recover-Perlscript, wich
flashes mtd0 and mtd1 (http://www.akk.org/~enrik/fbox/util/).
