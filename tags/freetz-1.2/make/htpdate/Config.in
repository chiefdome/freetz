		The HTTP Time Protocol (HTP) is used to synchronize a computer's time
	        with web servers as reference time source. Htpdate will synchronize your
	        computer's time by extracting timestamps from HTTP headers found
	        in web server responses. Htpdate can be used as a daemon, to keep your
	        computer synchronized.
