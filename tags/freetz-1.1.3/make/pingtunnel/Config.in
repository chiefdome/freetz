	    Ptunnel is an application that allows you to reliably tunnel TCP
	    connections to a remote host using ICMP echo request and reply packets,
	    commonly known as ping requests and replies. At first glance, this might
	    seem like a rather useless thing to do, but it can actually come in
	    handy in some cases.
