	    Makes the filesystem writeable. Changes are not reboot-persistent,
	    unless stored on a hard disk or on flash storage media. The way mini_fo
	    is configured here creates the overlay filesystem in the router's RAM
	    disk, so they definitely are *not* reboot-persistent. Nonetheless,
	    mini_fo is tremendously helpful, eliminating the need for tricks like
	    'mount -o bind' etc.
