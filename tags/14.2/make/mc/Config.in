	    GNU Midnight Commander (MC) is probably the best known Norton Commander
	    clone for free operating systems and definitely one of the most
	    powerful. While the version used here is quite old, it has the advantage
	    of being small enough for embedded systems. If you are looking for
	    something even smaller, feel free to give Deco a try, but don't expect
	    as much comfort and power there as you will get here.
