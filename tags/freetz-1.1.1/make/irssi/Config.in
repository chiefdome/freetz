		Irssi - the client of the future - is a terminal based IRC client for UNIX
		systems. It also supports SILC and ICB protocols via plugins. Features:
		  * Autologging: Irssi will automatically log any channels, queries or
		    special windows that you want.
		  * Formats and Themes: irssi has an easy yet powerful way to customize your
		    client's look and feel.
		  * Configurable keybindings: Irssi allows you to modify the default
		    keybindings and create your own so you can customize your client.
		  * Paste detection: Irssi tries to detect when you are pasting large amounts
		    of text, by looking at the speed that characters are entered; if such
		    pasting is detected [TAB]-characters are sent as-is instead of being
		    tab-completed and eventually ending up in a wrong destination window.

		Irssi-proxy is a plugin which allows to bind a port to each IRC server you are
		connected to. The copy of Irssi running the proxy works just as a normal
		client which you can use, but you can also connect one or more clients to it
		to share the connections.

		Using Irssi as a proxy has the major advantage of Irssi's power as an IRC
		client. You never have to worry about losing your connection to IRC.
