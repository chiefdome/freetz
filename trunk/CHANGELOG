TODO:
- classpath, jamvm
- give W900V a AVM-Webinterface (from 7150)
- bird and netsnmp don't build with more than one job

Latest changes:
- Mention 'make precompiled' in previously outdated README
- Hierarchical build structure improvements strive to avoid unnecessary
  recompiles, especially unwanted toolchain rebuilds. All packages'
  'precompiled' targets now depend on target 'uclibc', on the other hand, so
  they are rebuilt when necessary.
- Multi-job build improvements:
  * Added new config option for multiple jobs. This can now be configured in
    menuconfig.
  * New multijob config option will be used for kernel toolchain, target
    toolchain, libs and packages.
  * Targets that cannot be compiled with multiple jobs should use $(MAKE1)
    instead of $(MAKE).
  * multijob.sh is not needed anymore and will be removed in future releases.
    It now does not do anything anymore, just prints a "deprecated" warning.
  * Target "packages-precompiled" is removed because it is obsolete with these
    changes.
- Add uClibc config for 04.30
- Bump classpath to version 0.95
- Bump FUSE to version 2.6.5
- Fix typo in make/libs/Makefile.in concerning libpcap, making it dependent on
  libncurses config switch accidentally.
- Bump dnsmasq version to 2.39
- Extension for W701V: /sbin/mailer is copied from tk-firmware
- Enhance fwmod so it can be used to handle FW images by either specifying an
  alternative DOT_CONFIG file name or by explicitly providing command line
  parameters for often-used settings needed to unpack different firmware
  versions. Just call fwmod without any parameters to get a proper description.
  BTW: The DOT_CONFIG alternative may be a very small file consisting only of
  about five settings, if fwmod is just used to unpack (-u) an image.
- New package ctorrent 1.3.4-dnh3
- Bump transmission to version 0.72
- Fix awk segfault (busybox) when called without any parameters
- Bump Labor ECO version to 29.04.32-7153
- Clean up some obsolete code in Config.in and fwmod
- Fix small error in netsnmp package (update to 0.3): create /var/lib/snmp
- Rename BUSYBOX_MAKE_DIR to BUSYBOX_TOOLS_MAKE_DIR in
  tools/make/busybox-tools.mk. This provides for cleaner handling of the two
  different BB versions in DS-Mod during builds.
- Bump libevent version to 1.3b
- Bump tor version to 0.1.2.13
- Update tor package to 0.1.2.13
- Mod version number now says ds26-14.x rather than ds-0.2.9-14
- Bugfix for tools/busybox: make-include tried to apply all tools patches
  instead of only busybox-specific ones. I wonder why nobody ever complained.

=== in preparation for release ds26-15 ===

- Patches to inotify-enable uClibc
- New binary package 'inotify-tools' (inotifywait, inotifywatch)
- Added libelf library needed by ltrace - BUILD OK, BUT UNTESTED
- Added section "debug helpers" in menuconfig
- Added debug helper package strace (binary only)
- Added debug helper package ltrace (binary only) - COMPILES, BUT CRASHES
- Updated cifsmount package to 0.2: added CGI (web config) for up to three
  mounts; added init.d start/stop scripts; added script 'cifsmount' for more
  convenient command line (un-)mounting.

 === release ds26-14.4 ===

- Busybox patch for 'ash' shell: When a remote client (e.g. ssh) was killed,
  the remaining shell process would get into an endless loop stressing the CPU
  with >90%, making the system slow, unresponsive and possibly instable.
- Rudi Shell: new optional environment variable (or non-GUI POST parameter,
  respecively) FORM_download_name enables users to define a target name for
  files downloaded via scripting.
- Menuconfig: help texts for all brandings explaining briefly what a branding
  is and explaining that at least one of them should be selected for the
  firmware to work.
- Bump callmonitor version to 1.9.2
- Fix busybox rebuild when config changes (copied from openwrt) 
- Add FritzBox Fon (06.04.30) to ds26
- Disable CONFIG_KMOD kernel option (module auto-loader) because of missing
  symbol in original kernel. This is needed to make iptables run smoothly, but
  also makes it necessary to load iptables modules with modprobe or insmod.
- Update Firewall CGI to explicitly use modprobe/rmmod, because CONFIG_KMOD
  was removed from default kernel config
- Version update for USB and VPN 'labor' firmware (AURA 7125, VPN 6937)
- Ntfs3g: bump version to 1.417
- Fix typo in make/avm-gpl/avm-gpl.mk
- Minor menuconfig improvements:
  * Don't show open source package selection, always usedefault (currently
    04.30 for 7141, 04.29 for all other supported boxes)
  * Rename "firmware type" to "hardware type"
  * Rename "firmware version" to "firmware language"
- Kernel build: do not use /sbin/depmod while cross-compiling
- Integrate new AVM open source package (7141-04.30)
- Bftpd: bump version to 1.8 and update download site
- Fix typo in toolchain/make/target/uclibc/uclibc.mk causing make to always use
  the precompiled uClibc, the manual build never got fired.
- Update Speedport W701V to firmware version 33.04.26
- Improved menuconfig tool adopted from buildroot2:
  * Comprehensive online help
  * Options' help texts also show dependency information:
    + Which condition(s) does an option depend on?
    + By which other option(s) was an option selected?
    + Which other options does an option select?
    + Where is an option defined (file name + line no.)?
  * Seach mode: wildcard search for option names via "/" hotkey.
    By the way: search mode also has online help.
- Added download mirror #3 to Config.in
- tools/make/busybox-tools.mk: activate download target on demand to avoid
  collision with identical target for regular busybox on one hand and to
  avoid make complaining about a missing target when building tools busybox
  from scratch on the other hand.
- tools/ds_download: changed 'od -D' to 'od -d' to make it compatible with
  old versions of GNU coreutils (e.g. od 5.2.1)

=== release ds26-14.3 ===

- Cross-cutting changes in ds-mod-specific package download:
  * New shell script tools/ds_download provides a uniform way to download
    ds-mod-specific packages such as application and add-on packages as well
    as precompiled toolchains. The script first checks a predefined list of
    download servers (mirrors) and only uses an optionally provided "original"
    server as fallback, which is important for new package versions not
    available on mirrors yet.
  * New variable DL_TOOL in Makefile points to tools/ds_download
  * List of download sites (mirrors) can be edited in menuconfig (Advanced
    options -> DS-Mod package download sites). Currently there are five slots
    for download servers, two of which have default values. Two others are
    reserved for later use and #5 is freely editable by users. This enables
    users to set up their private mirrors on their own LAN or WAN servers.
  * *.mk files loading mod-specific packages have all been made "mirror-aware",
    i.e. they all call DL_TOOL with the appropriate parameters. Specifically,
    all former primary download sites have been preserved as fallback servers.
- Major menuconfig restructuring. For example (there is more):
  * Iptables' shared libs and kernel modules are dependent on a top level
    setting and can be deselected as  whole groups.
  * JamVM + classpath + ffi-sable can now be found in one place and are also
    interdependent.
  * Sub-menus in packages section
  * Major case first letters in package names
  * More and improved menu descriptions
  * Removed redundant library descriptions for iptables and classpath stuff by
    putting them in groups (see above).
  * Some changes in include structure ('source' commands in Config.in files),
    e.g. several libs' descriptions are now closer to their required top level
    applications.
- Fix firmware build: iptables binary was always included in image, even if not
  selected in menuconfig.
- Fix syslogd ring buffer size parameter leading to "Starting syslogd...failed";
  package version updated to 0.2.1
- Mini_fo package now listed as regular package, not "testing" anymore (no
  known problem reports)
- Tinyproxy package now listed as "testing" and "unfinished, experts only",
  because there is no web config yet.
- Obsolete package telefon removed (and "obsolete" section with it)
- Fix make target 'busybox-tools-clean', so busybox and makedevs are removed.
  This avoids an error when subsequently calling 'make precompiled' again.
- Fix mini_fo: use modprobe instead of insmod, because module path can differ
  with other box types. Package updated to 0.2.
- External IP can now be determined without calling external servers: Shell
  script /bin/get_ip prints external IP to stdout, giving the user a choice
  between three different methods:
    -w, --webcm    - webcm CGI handler method [default]
    -d, --dsld     - showdsldstat method (use only with kernel 2.6 firmwares)
    -e, --extquery - external site query method (ask whatismyip.org)
- Fix typo in make target 'kernel-clean'
- netsnmp.cgi is now executable, so the package can be web-configured.
- Fix typo in kernel/Config.in: DS_MODULE_crc-ccitt -> DS_MODULE_crc_ccitt.
  So menuconfig no longer complains about DS_MODULE_ppp_async.
- Suppress tar "lone zero block" warning when unpacking certain firmware images
- Don't be so restrictive on addon-names (e.g. openvpn-2.1.offline)

=== release ds-0.2.9_26-14.2 ===

- Fix fakeroot problems with chown (operation not permitted) on systems with
  newer glibc + coreutils combinations using *at(). The version has been
  promoted to fakeroot-1.5.10 and a new patch for *at() is available.
- Fix package virtualip-cgi and promote to version 0.4.1. There were bugs in
  the make script and in the download package itself.
- Fixed 'tar --exclude .svn' for dnsmasq, cifsmount and deco: option was not
  set for '*-package' targets (tar -c), but for unpack targets (tar -x).
- Remove "depends on DS_REPLACE_KERNEL" for iptables libs
- Checking for and cleaning up Subversion directories in build/modified
  before packing firmware image
- Updated copyright notices and acknowledgements
- Updated MOTD to reflect DS-Mod_26 series (different ASCII art) 
- Fix menuconfig warning concerning download toolchain
- Remove kernel-toolchain from target-toolchain prerequisites 
- Add gcc-4.1.2 to target toolchain menu after it has been fixed
- FUSE module got lost when removed KERNEL_MODULES_DIR
- Add mirror for download toolchain
- Added, fixed and enhanced a few help texts for menuconfig in Config.in and
  toolchain/Config.in.
- Introducing detailed help texts for menuconfig's shared library section.
  Unfortunately, this blows up libs/Config.in immensely - even more so, because
  sub-menus cannot get their own help texts for technical reasons. So, for menus
  containing several entries there is a lot of redundancy (i.e. repetition). The
  worst example is iptables, but there are others as well.
- Add xdelta3 (for binary diffs) to build tools
- Added and enhanced menuconfig help texts for several packages: screen,
  matrixtunnel, lynx, dropbear, wol-cgi, mini_fo, lua, callmonitor, samba, mc,
  cifsmount, deco.
- Set tinyproxy autostart to manual
- Bump 5050 Firmware to 04.31
- Add patch and modules for mppe-mppc
- Increase MOD_LIMIT default to 61440
- Extra patch for soft-float problem
- Delete some unnecessary files
- Forgot to add patches for gdb 6.3 and 6.4
