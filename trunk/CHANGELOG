TODO:
- classpath, jamvm
- give W900V a AVM-Webinterface (from 7150)
- bird and netsnmp don't build with more than one job

Latest changes:
- Mini_fo package now listed as regular package, not "testing" anymore (no
  known problem reports)
- Tinyproxy package now listed as "testing" and "unfinished, experts only",
  because there is no web config yet.
- Obsolete package telefon removed (and "obsolete" section with it)
- Fix make target 'busybox-tools-clean', so busybox and makedevs are removed.
  This avoids an error when subsequently calling 'make precompiled' again.
- Fix mini_fo: use modprobe instead of insmod, because module path can differ
  with other box types. Package updated to 0.2.
- Fix typo in make target 'kernel-clean'
- netsnmp.cgi is now executable, so the package can be web-configured.
- Fix typo in kernel/Config.in: DS_MODULE_crc-ccitt -> DS_MODULE_crc_ccitt.
  So menuconfig no longer complains about DS_MODULE_ppp_async.

=== release ds-0.2.9_26-14.2 ===

- Fix fakeroot problems with chown (operation not permitted) on systems with
  newer glibc + coreutils combinations using *at(). The version has been
  promoted to fakeroot-1.5.10 and a new patch for *at() is available.
- Fix package virtualip-cgi and promote to version 0.4.1. There were bugs in
  the make script and in the download package itself.
- Suppress tar "lone zero block" warning when unpacking certain firmware images
- External IP can now be determined without calling external servers: Shell
  script /bin/get_ip prints external IP to stdout, giving the user a choice
  between three different methods:
    -w, --webcm    - webcm CGI handler method [default]
    -d, --dsld     - showdsldstat method (use only with kernel 2.6 firmwares)
    -e, --extquery - external site query method (ask whatismyip.org)
- Added libelf library needed by ltrace - BUILD OK, BUT UNTESTED
- Added section "debug helpers" in menuconfig
- Added debug helper package strace (binary only)
- Added debug helper package ltrace (binary only) - COMPILES, BUT CRASHES
- Updated cifsmount package to 0.2: added CGI (web config) for up to three
  mounts; added init.d start/stop scripts; added script 'cifsmount' for more
  convenient command line (un-)mounting.
- Fixed 'tar --exclude .svn' for dnsmasq, cifsmount and deco: option was not
  set for '*-package' targets (tar -c), but for unpack targets (tar -x).
- Remove "depends on DS_REPLACE_KERNEL" for iptables libs 
- Checking for and cleaning up Subversion directories in build/modified
  before packing firmware image
- Updated copyright notices and acknowledgements
- Updated MOTD to reflect DS-Mod_26 series (different ASCII art) 
- Fix menuconfig warning concerning download toolchain
- Remove kernel-toolchain from target-toolchain prerequisites 
- Add gcc-4.1.2 to target toolchain menu after it has been fixed
- FUSE module got lost when removed KERNEL_MODULES_DIR
- Add mirror for download toolchain
- Added, fixed and enhanced a few help texts for menuconfig in Config.in and
  toolchain/Config.in.
- Introducing detailed help texts for menuconfig's shared library section.
  Unfortunately, this blows up libs/Config.in immensely - even more so, because
  sub-menus cannot get their own help texts for technical reasons. So, for menus
  containing several entries there is a lot of redundancy (i.e. repetition). The
  worst example is iptables, but there are others as well.
- Add xdelta3 (for binary diffs) to build tools
- Added and enhanced menuconfig help texts for several packages: screen,
  matrixtunnel, lynx, dropbear, wol-cgi, mini_fo, lua, callmonitor, samba, mc,
  cifsmount, deco.
- Set tinyproxy autostart to manual
- Bump 5050 Firmware to 04.31
- Add patch and modules for mppe-mppc
- Increase MOD_LIMIT default to 61440
- Extra patch for soft-float problem
- Delete some unnecessary files
- Forgot to add patches for gdb 6.3 and 6.4
