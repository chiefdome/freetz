		Mount an ext2 filesystem (fs) from an USB stick and use it as a
		root fs which is fully writable and basically unlimited in size.
		The Linux kernel will still be loaded from your box and during 
		the first phase of the init process the SquashFS on the box is 
		still used, but after the USB-root is mounted, we pivot_root
		into it and it becomes the new root fs. The read-only fs on the
		box can still be accessed under /oldroot, but is absolutely not
		necessary anymore after pivot_root.

		Having said that, it should be clear that the usb stick	should 
		contain everything necessary to run the box. Usually you just 
		create a full copy of a target fs (e.g. from 
		build/modified/filesystem or from an unpacked firmware image) 
		and start modifying it as needed. The binaries (kernel modules,
		executables, shared libraries) used therein just have to fit the
		kernel installed on the box.

		Note: There currently is no web interface for this package, 
		because an USB-root is an expert thing anyway. The command-line
		interface and help screen of /etc/init.d/rc.usbroot makes it 
		pretty easy to (de-)activate and configure the functionality of
		this package. As configuration data are stored in bootloader 
		environment rather than in TFFS like for other packages, this
		package is special anyway.
