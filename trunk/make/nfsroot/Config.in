		Mount a remote filesystem (fs) from an NFS server and use it as a root fs
		which is fully writable and basically unlimited in size. The Linux kernel will
		still be loaded from your box and during the first phase of the init process
		the SquashFS on the box is still used, but after the NFS-root is mounted, we
		pivot_root into it and it becomes the new root fs. The read-only fs on the box
		can still be accessed under /oldroot, but is absolutely not necessary anymore
		after pivot_root.

		Having said that, it should be clear that the remote folder to be mounted
		should contain everything necessary to run the box. Usually you just create
		a full copy of a target fs (e.g. from build/modified/filesystem or from an
		unpacked firmware image) and start modifying it as needed. The binaries
		(kernel modules, executables, shared libraries) used therein just have to fit
		the kernel installed on the box.

		Note: The mini_fo overlay filesystem will not be used if an NFS-root was
		mounted first (see mini_fo package). Still, both packages can be
		installed at the same time, because mini_fo is still useful if NFS-root
		is decativated.

		Note: This package needs "replace kernel" because a kernel patch is necessary
		to make the 'nfsroot' bootloader environment variable usable for our purpose.
		So, if if "replace kernel" is inactive, you will not see this package in
		menuconfig.

		Note: There currently is no web interface for this package, because an
		NFS-root is an expert thing anyway. The command-line interface and help screen
		of /etc/init.d/rc.nfs makes it pretty easy to (de-)activate and configure the
		functionality of this package. As configuration data are stored in bootloader
		environment rather than in TFFS like for other packages, this package is
		special anyway.
