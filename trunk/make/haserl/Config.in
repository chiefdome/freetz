		Haserl is a small program that uses shell or Lua script to create
		cgi web scripts. It is intended for environments where PHP or ruby
		are too big. A typical use is to run cgi scripts in an embedded
		environment, using a small web server, such as mini-httpd, lighty,
		or the server built into busybox.
