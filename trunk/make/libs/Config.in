		Filesystem in Userspace (FUSE) is a free Unix kernel module that allows

		to the actual kernel interfaces. FUSE was officially merged into the
		mainstream Linux kernel tree in kernel version 2.6.14.
		
		FUSE is particularly useful for writing virtual file systems. Unlike
		traditional filesystems which essentially save data to and retrieve data
		from disk, virtual filesystems do not actually store data themselves.
		They act as a view or translation of an existing filesystem or storage
		device. In principle, any resource available to FUSE implementation can
		be exported as a file system.
		
		In DS-Mod, the NTFS package depends on libfuse, for example.

		Netfilter is the set of hooks within the Linux kernel for intercepting

		netfilter is the firewall which filters packets, but the hooks are also
		used by a component which performs network address translation, and by
		another which provides ipchains backwards compatibility. These
		components are usually Loadable Kernel Modules.
		
		iptables is the name of the user space tool by which administrators
		create rules for the packet filtering and NAT modules. While technically
		iptables is merely the tool which controls the packet filtering and NAT
		components within the kernel, the name iptables is often used to refer
		to the entire infrastructure, including netfilter, connection tracking
		and NAT, as well as the tool itself. iptables is a standard part of all

		Libgcrypt is a general-purpose cryptographic library based on the code
		from GnuPG. It provides functions for all cryptographic building blocks:
		symmetric ciphers (AES, DES, Blowfish, CAST5, Twofish, and Arcfour),
		hash algorithms (MD4, MD5, RIPE-MD160, SHA-1, and TIGER-192), MACs
		(HMAC for all hash algorithms), public key algorithms (RSA, ElGamal,

	default n
	help
		LZO is a portable lossless data compression library written in ANSI C.
		It offers pretty fast compression and *very* fast decompression.
		Decompression requires no memory. In addition there are slower
		compression levels achieving a quite competitive compression ratio while
		still decompressing at this very high speed. 

config DS_LIB_libevent

	default n
	help
		libevent is an asynchronous event notification software library.
		
		The libevent API provides a mechanism to execute a callback function
		when a specific event occurs on a file descriptor or after a timeout
		has been reached. Furthermore, libevent also support callbacks due to
		signals or regular timeouts.
		
		libevent is meant to replace the event loop found in event-driven
		network servers. An application just needs to call event_dispatch() and
		then add or remove events dynamically without having to change the event
		loop.
