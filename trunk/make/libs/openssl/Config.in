		crypto - OpenSSL cryptographic library

		The OpenSSL crypto library implements a wide range of cryptographic
		algorithms used in various Internet standards. The services provided by
		this library are used by the OpenSSL implementations of SSL, TLS and
		S/MIME, and they have also been used to implement SSH, OpenPGP, and
		other cryptographic standards.

		libcrypto consists of a number of sub-libraries that implement the
		individual algorithms. The functionality includes symmetric encryption,
		public key cryptography and key agreement, certificate handling,
		cryptographic hash functions and a cryptographic pseudo-random number
		generator.

		SSL - OpenSSL SSL/TLS library

		The OpenSSL ssl library implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3)
		and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols. It provides a rich API.

		In Freetz, e.g. Tor, sTunnel and OpenVPN depend on libssl.
