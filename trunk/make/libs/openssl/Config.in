		crypto - OpenSSL cryptographic library

		The OpenSSL crypto library implements a wide range of cryptographic
		algorithms used in various Internet standards. The services provided by
		this library are used by the OpenSSL implementations of SSL, TLS and
		S/MIME, and they have also been used to implement SSH, OpenPGP, and
		other cryptographic standards.

		libcrypto consists of a number of sub-libraries that implement the
		individual algorithms. The functionality includes symmetric encryption,
		public key cryptography and key agreement, certificate handling,
		cryptographic hash functions and a cryptographic pseudo-random number
		generator.
