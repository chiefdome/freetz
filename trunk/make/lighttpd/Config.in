		Security, speed, compliance, and flexibility -- all of these describe lighttpd
		(pron. lighty) which is rapidly redefining efficiency of a webserver; as it is
		designed and optimized for high performance environments. With a small memory
		footprint compared to other web-servers, effective management of the cpu-load,
		and advanced feature set (FastCGI, SCGI, Auth, Output-Compression,
		URL-Rewriting and many more) lighttpd is the perfect solution for every server
		that is suffering load problems.
		In case you want to configure virtual hosts, you may want to
		consider the package onlinechanged-cgi which allows you to
		configure multiple DynDNS entries for your box.
