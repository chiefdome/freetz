		GNU Midnight Commander (MC) is probably the best known Norton Commander
		clone for free operating systems and definitely one of the most
		powerful. If you are looking for something smaller, feel free to give
		Deco a try, but don't expect as much comfort and power there as you 
		will get here.

config DS_MC_INTERNAL_EDITOR
	bool "Internal editor"
	depends on DS_PACKAGE_MC
	default y
	help
		MC features an internal editor which can be started by F4. If you
		decativate it because you want to use vi or nano instead, F4 will
		still work. By default, vi is called on the box, but exporting EDITOR
		so it points to another editor of your choice will get you the
		combination of file manager and editor you desire. :-)

		Switching off this feature saves about 95 KB in the main binary.

config DS_MC_SUBSHELL
	bool "Subshell support"
	depends on DS_PACKAGE_MC
	select DS_PACKAGE_BASH
	default n
	help
		MC subshell support (~15 KB + bash).

config DS_MC_ONLINE_HELP
	bool "Online help"
	depends on DS_PACKAGE_MC
	default y
	help
		MC comes with an online help file which can be viewed via 'F1'.

		Switching off this feature saves about 115 KB in the file system.

config DS_MC_WITH_NCURSES
	bool "Use ncurses library instead of internal mcslang"
	depends on DS_PACKAGE_MC
	select DS_LIB_libncurses
	default n
	help
		If mc is linked against libncurses (200 KB) the size of the mc binary
		is reduced by about 50 KB, but if you do not need libncurses for any
		other package, those 50 KB are a good investment in order to remove
		libncurses from the firmware image and save (200 - 50) KB = 150 KB.
