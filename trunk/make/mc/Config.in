	help
		GNU Midnight Commander (MC) is probably the best known Norton Commander
		clone for free operating systems and definitely one of the most
		powerful. While the version used here is quite old, it has the advantage
		of being small enough for embedded systems. If you are looking for
		something even smaller, feel free to give Deco a try, but don't expect
		as much comfort and power there as you will get here.

config DS_MC_SYNTAX_COLOURING
	bool "Syntax colouring"
	depends on DS_PACKAGE_MC
	default y
	help
		MC can do syntax-highlighting for several predefined file types.

		Switching off this feature saves about 70 KB in the main binary.

config DS_MC_ONLINE_HELP
	bool "Online help"
	depends on DS_PACKAGE_MC
	default y
	help
		MC comes with an opnline help file which can be viewed via 'F1'.

		Switching off this feature saves about 115 KB in the (unsquashed)
		file system, probably much less in overall SquashFS size. Yet better
		than nothing if you do not need the online help file.
