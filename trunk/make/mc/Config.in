		GNU Midnight Commander (MC) is probably the best known Norton Commander
		clone for free operating systems and definitely one of the most
		powerful. While the version used here is quite old, it has the advantage
		of being small enough for embedded systems. If you are looking for
		something even smaller, feel free to give Deco a try, but don't expect
		as much comfort and power there as you will get here.

config DS_MC_INTERNAL_EDITOR
	bool "Internal editor"
	depends on DS_PACKAGE_MC
	default y
	help
		MC features an internal editor which can be started by F4.  If you
		decativate it because you want to use vi or nano instead, F4 will
		still work. By default, vi is called on the box, but exporting EDITOR
		so it points to another editor of your choice will get you the
		combination of file manager and editor you desire. :-)

		Switching off this feature saves about 86 KB in the main binary.

config DS_MC_SYNTAX_COLOURING
	bool "Syntax colouring"
	depends on DS_MC_INTERNAL_EDITOR
	default y
	help
		MC's internal editor can do syntax-highlighting for several predefined
		file types: unified diff, LSM, shell script, Perl, Python, nroff
		(man-page source), HTML, Pascal, LaTeX 2.09, C/C++, change-log,
		makefile.

		The syntax definitions are hard-coded into the main binary. Switching
		off this feature saves about 70 KB in the binary.

config DS_MC_ONLINE_HELP
	bool "Online help"
	depends on DS_PACKAGE_MC
	default y
	help
		MC comes with an online help file which can be viewed via 'F1'.

		Switching off this feature saves about 115 KB in the (unsquashed)
		file system, probably much less in overall SquashFS size. Yet better
		than nothing if you do not need the online help file.
