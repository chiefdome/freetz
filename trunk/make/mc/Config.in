		GNU Midnight Commander (MC) is probably the best known Norton Commander
		clone for free operating systems and definitely one of the most
		powerful. If you are looking for something smaller, feel free to give
		Deco a try, but don't expect as much comfort and power there as you 
		will get here.

	bool "Online help"
	depends on DS_PACKAGE_MC
	default y
	help
		MC comes with an online help file which can be viewed via 'F1'.

		Switching off this feature saves about 115 KB in the (unsquashed)
		file system.
