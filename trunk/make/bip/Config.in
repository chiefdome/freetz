		Bip is an IRC proxy, which means it keeps connected to your
		preferred IRC servers, can store the logs for you, and even send
		them back to your IRC client(s) upon connection. You may want to
		use bip to keep your logfiles (in a unique format and on a unique
		computer) whatever your client is, when you connect from multiple
		workstations, or when you simply want to have a playback of what
		was said while you were away.

config DS_BIP_WITH_SSL
	bool "build with SSL support"
	depends on DS_PACKAGE_BIP
