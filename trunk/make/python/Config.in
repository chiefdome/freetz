		Python is a remarkably powerful dynamic programming language that is used
		in a wide variety of application domains.
		CAUTION: Python adds roughly 7.5 MB to 12 MB (depending on your choice of
		         modules) of uncompressed data to your image. In most cases, it should therefore be externalized.

		Causes all *.pyc files usually residing in /usr/lib/python2.7 to be
		compressed into one large file, /usr/lib/python27.zip. Thereafter, only
		*.so files and some small text data are left in /usr/lib/python2.7, while
		Python will (efficiently) read all *.pyc files from the zip archive.
		Leaving this option enabled saves you about 50% of space at virtually no
		cost.
