		Subversion, also known as svn, is a version control system much like
		the Concurrent Versions System (CVS). Version control systems allow
		many individuals (who may be distributed geographically) to collaborate
		on a set of files (typically source code). Subversion has all the major
		features of CVS, plus certain new features that CVS users often wish
		they had.
