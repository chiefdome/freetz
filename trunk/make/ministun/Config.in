		Mini STUN client (code borrowed from Asterisk, source code provided by
		Vladislav Grishenko) efficiently determines the external IP by querying
		a public STUN server. Thus, this binary can optionally be used by
		Freetz's /usr/bin/get_ip as an alternative to querying a site like
		http://checkip.dyndns.org via wget.

		The uncompressed binary size is about 7 KB.
