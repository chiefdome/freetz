	    dtmfbox is a tool, which can be used to control different tasks
	    over telephone keyboard (via DTMF). The DTMF signals are 
	    handed over to a scriptfile.
	    
	    While scriptfile running, you can answer an incoming call, record
	    or play a wave file, make another call (connect it with another), etc.
	    
	    The scriptfiles that are included in this package, contain an 
	    answering machine, administration menu and a callback/callthrough 
	    script.
