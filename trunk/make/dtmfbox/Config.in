		dtmfbox is a small softswitch application, that can be used to
		control different tasks over telephone keyboard (via DTMF).
		The DTMF signals are handed over to a scriptfile or a plugin.

		While scriptfile/plugin running, you can answer an incoming call,
		record or play a wave file, make another call, bridge calls, etc.

		The scriptfiles included in this package, contain an
		answering machine, callback/callthrough script, reverse lookup,
		anti-callcenter script, weather forecast, webradio ...

		The application can also be configured as registrar, to allow
		SIP client connects.
