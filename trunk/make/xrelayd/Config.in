		SSL tunnel based on XySSL. Xrelayd is a stripped down version of
		stunnel based on XySSL library. Essentially, this package makes your
		router's websrv or httpd SSL-enabled, offering you the option of remote
		configuration via WWW or secure remote use of features like Rudi-Shell.

		This package will eventually replace Matrixtunnel, even though the
		XySSL library is somewhat bigger than MatrixSSL. Its command line
		interface is identical to Matrixtunnel's, so switching should be easy
		for all users.
