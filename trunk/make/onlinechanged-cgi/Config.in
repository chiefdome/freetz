		When the online-status changes (e.g. a forced re-connect)
		this CGI allows you to specify arbitrary commands which are
		executed at that event. The following different change events
		are considered: initial start of the box, going online and
		going offline.

		As an example this package includes a script which fixes the
		default route set wrong by AVM's dsld in some cases.
