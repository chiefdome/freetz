	    httpry is a specialized packet sniffer designed for displaying
	    and logging HTTP traffic. It is not intended to perform analysis
	    itself, but to capture, parse, and log the traffic for later
	    analysis. It can be run in real-time displaying the traffic as
	    it is parsed, or as a daemon process that logs to an output file.
	    It is written to be as lightweight and flexible as possible, so
	    that it can be easily adaptable to different applications.
