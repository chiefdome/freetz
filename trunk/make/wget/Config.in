		GNU Wget is a free software package for retrieving files using
		HTTP, HTTPS and FTP, the most widely-used Internet protocols. It
		is a non-interactive commandline tool, so it may easily be 
		called from scripts, cron jobs, terminals, etc.
		
		This package replaces busybox's wget applet. But this one adds
		about 240 KB.
