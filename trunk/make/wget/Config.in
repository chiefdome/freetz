	bool "Wget 1.10.2 (binary only)"
	default n
	help
		GNU Wget is a free software package for retrieving files using
		HTTP, HTTPS and FTP, the most widely-used Internet protocols. It
		is a non-interactive commandline tool, so it may easily be 
		called from scripts, cron jobs, terminals, etc.
		
		This package replaces busybox's wget applet. But this one adds
		about 240 KB.

	bool "build with SSL support"
	depends on DS_PACKAGE_WGET
	select DS_LIB_libssl
