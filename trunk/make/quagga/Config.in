	    The Quagga Software Routing Suite

	    A routing software package that provides TCP/IP based routing services
	    with routing protocols support such as RIPv1, RIPv2, RIPng, OSPFv2,
	    OSPFv3, BGP-4, and BGP-4+.

	    This package does not provide any configuration help yet, though you
	    can edit the configuration file(s) via the web interface. You can
	    find the documentation at http://www.quagga.net/.
	    YOU SHOULD NOT SELECT THIS PACKAGE (I.E. YOU DO NOT NEED IT)
	    IF YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO CONFIGURE THE ROUTING DAEMONS!
	    (However: a guided/safe config interface is on the todo list ;-)
