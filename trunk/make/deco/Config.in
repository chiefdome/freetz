		Norton commander clone. Compared with Midnight Commander (mc) it is
		considerably smaller, but also significantly less powerful and less
		fancy-looking. Use it if you want to trade power for file and memory
		footprint, but still feel like requiring a file manager instead of a
		plain UNIX shell. Uses about 149K uncompressed space.
