		Makes the filesystem writeable. Changes are not reboot-persistent,
		unless stored on a hard disk or on flash storage media. The way mini_fo
		is configured here creates the overlay filesystem in the router's RAM
		disk, so they definitely are *not* reboot-persistent. Nonetheless,
		mini_fo is tremendously helpful, eliminating the need for tricks like
		'mount -o bind' etc.

		Note: The mini_fo root filesystem will not be used if an NFS-root was
		mounted first (see NFS-root package). Still, both packages can be
		installed at the same time, because mini_fo is still useful if NFS-root
		is decativated.

		Enables possibility to store filesystem changes persisten to jffs2.
