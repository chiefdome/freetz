		JamVM - extremely small Java VM

		JamVM is a new Java Virtual Machine which conforms to the JVM
		specification version 2 (blue book). In comparison to most other VM's
		(free and commercial) it is extremely small, with a stripped executable
		on PowerPC of only ~160K, and Intel 140K. However, unlike other small
		VMs (e.g. KVM) it is designed to support the full specification, and
		includes support for object finalisation, Soft/Weak/Phantom References,
		class-unloading, the Java Native Interface (JNI) and the Reflection API.

		Class Libraries: JamVM is designed to use the GNU Classpath Java class
		library. A number of classes are reference classes which must be
		modified for a particular VM. These are provided along with JamVM (see
		INSTALL). JamVM should always work with the latest development snapshot
		of Classpath (currently 0.93). It should also work with the latest
		version direct from CVS, and the upcoming 0.94 snapshot (but check the
		Classpath mailing lists for possible patches). Later snapshots of
		Classpath may also work, if no modifications have been made to the VM
		interface.

		Note, JamVM will not work with the class library from Sun or IBM's
		Virtual Machines.
