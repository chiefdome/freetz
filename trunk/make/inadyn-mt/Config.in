		INADYN - Simple Dynamic DNS client.

		INADYN is a free DynDNS client. It gives the possibility to have your
		own fixed hostname registered on the internet, although your IP might
		be changing. It checks periodically whether the IP address stored by
		the DNS server is the real current IP address of the machine that is
		running INADYN.
