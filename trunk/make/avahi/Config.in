		An mDNS/DNS-SD (aka RendezVous/Bonjour/ZeroConf) implementation
		(library).  Avahi is a system which facilitates service
		discovery on a local network -- this means that you can plug
		your laptop or computer into a network and instantly be able
		to view other people who you can chat with, find printers to
		print to or find files being shared. This kind of technology
		is already found in MacOS X (branded 'Rendezvous', 'Bonjour'
		and sometimes 'ZeroConf') and is very convenient.
