		Streamripper records mp3 streams.
		For shoutcast style streams it finds the "meta data"
		or track separation data, and uses that as a marker
		for where the track should be separated. Ogg support
		is currently disabled.

		The streamripper binary adds 122kB to the image.
		Additional space may be needed for shared libraries.
