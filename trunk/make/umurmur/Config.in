		umurmur is a minimalistic Mumble server primarily
		targeted to run on routers using less resources.
		It targets to fill the needs of a pretty small group
		of users communicating, which in part originates from
		the other goal of working well on a small system with
		a limited CPU and limited amount of disk space. It also
		aims to minimize writing to the disk since these kinds
		of systems usually only has a flash memory for disk.
		umurmur supports a subset of the features of Murmur.
