		inotify-tools - watch file and directory access

		inotify-tools is a C library and a set of command-line programs for
		Linux providing a simple interface to inotify. These programs can be
		used to monitor and act upon filesystem events. The programs are
		written in C and have no dependencies other than a Linux kernel
		supporting inotify.

		inotifywait
		This command simply blocks for inotify events, making it appropriate
		for use in shell scripts. It can watch any set of files and
		directories, and can recursively watch entire directory trees.

		inotifywatch
		inotifywatch collects filesystem usage statistics and outputs counts of
		each inotify event.
		
		Please read http://trac.freetz.org/wiki/packages/inotify_tools for further
		details. Improper usage can lead to reboots.
