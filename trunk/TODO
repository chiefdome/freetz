To-do list for ds26
===================

$Id$

- Make ccache build script aware of gcc version change (needs rebuild in that
  case)
- Open question: Why do we have libjpeg if it is not used by any package?
  Answer (by olistudent): SANE seems to need it, but the scanners do not run
  because AVM have not finished their USB driver yet. We should check new
  packages to see if they ever provide a working version.
- Perhaps integrate build option to replace AVM websrv by Busybox httpd (remove
  websrv from firmware, patch start script for AVM UI so as to use httpd).
  Status: Having checked in a patch, httpd seems to work well instead of websrv,
  even with LCR Updater by telefonsparbuch.de. A configurable option to replace
  websrv has yet to be done, though.
- Experiment with and possibly use dietlibc to create smaller binaries by
  statically compiling in stuff usually dynamically linked to uClibc.
- Determine the best way to include rpath, i.e. something like
  export LD_RUN_PATH=/mod/lib:/lib:/usr/lib
  into makefile(s). It should be applied to all binaries for the target
  system, but not to tools and toolchain binaries.
  comment (olistudent): Perhaps we should leave things as they are (LD_LIBRARY_PATH)
- Enhance Virtual-IP-CGI and Openntpd so it supports other (and possibly multiple)
  interfaces than lan:1 (http://www.ip-phone-forum.de/showpost.php?p=886345)
- Make flash firmware button in dsmod webinterface (especially for W701V and W900 
  users because they can not flash over original webinterface)
