To-do list for ds26
===================

$Id$

- Make ccache build script aware of gcc version change (needs rebuild in that
  case)

- Open question: Why do we have libjpeg if it is not used by any package?
    Answer (by olistudent): SANE seems to need it, but the scanners do not run
    because AVM have not finished their USB driver yet. We should check new
    packages to see if they ever provide a working version.

- Experiment with and possibly use dietlibc to create smaller binaries by
  statically compiling in stuff usually dynamically linked to uClibc.

- Enhance Virtual-IP-CGI and Openntpd so it supports other (and possibly
  multiple) interfaces than lan:1
  (http://www.ip-phone-forum.de/showpost.php?p=886345)

- Make flash firmware button in dsmod webinterface (especially for W701V and
  W900 users because they can not flash over original webinterface)

- Do the same for source code patches as we have done for the firmware
  patches: give them a thorough auto-fix treatment similar to the new modpatch
  feature.

- ldd on the box would be nice to have as a debug-thingy
    Remark (by kriegaex): Yes, maybe. But why bloat box's memory if we can
    just as easy run toolchain/target/mipsel-linux-uclibc/bin/ldd on mipsel
    binaries from the target toolchain as tools/lib_report.sh does?
    Remark (by olistudent): In uclibc.mk there is a target named 
    uclibc-target-utils. This copies ldd for target to root/usr/bin.
    Remark (by kriegaex): I think we should offer an option under "debug
    tools" in menuconfig then. The file is really small and it works well,
    I tested it on the box. I do not know how this is best done, because it is
    part of the toolchain rather than a regular package, but maybe Oliver has
    an idea.

- Think about whether we can do something about LCR Auto Updater not working
  without httpd restart, if httpd replaces websrv.

- Make rc.mini_fo use kernel_args API

- Get "telnetd vs. getcons" hangups fixed in BusyBox or another way.
