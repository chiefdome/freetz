To-do list for ds26
===================

$Id$

- Make ccache build script aware of gcc version change (needs rebuild in that
  case)
- Open question: Why do we have libjpeg if it is not used by any package?
  Answer (by olistudent): SANE seems to need it, but the scanners do not run
  because AVM have not finished their USB driver yet. We should check new
  packages to see if they ever provide a working version.
- Experiment with and possibly use dietlibc to create smaller binaries by
  statically compiling in stuff usually dynamically linked to uClibc.
- Determine the best way to include rpath, i.e. something like
  "export LD_RUN_PATH=/mod/lib:/lib:/usr/lib", into makefile(s). It should be
  applied to all binaries for the target system, but not to tools and
  toolchain binaries.
  Comment (olistudent): Perhaps we should leave things as they are
  (LD_LIBRARY_PATH)
- Enhance Virtual-IP-CGI and Openntpd so it supports other (and possibly
  multiple) interfaces than lan:1
  (http://www.ip-phone-forum.de/showpost.php?p=886345)
- Make flash firmware button in dsmod webinterface (especially for W701V and
  W900 users because they can not flash over original webinterface)
- Do the same for source code patches as we have done for the firmware
  patches: give them a thorough auto-fix treatment similar to the new modpatch
  feature.
- Kernel configuration for W501V has to be done (4mb_26 ohio!)
