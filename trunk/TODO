To-do list for ds26
===================

$Id$

- Debootstrap needs 'ar' busybox applet
- Integrate + test Enrik's working ltrace version
- Integrate nano package
- Integrate ntpd package
- Integrate + test httpd patch from busybox mailing list
- Integrate kriegaex's boot analysis tool (log all file accesses using
  inotify-tools)
- Make ccache build script aware of gcc version change (needs rebuild in that
  case)
- Fix libgcc_s build prerequisites, so it is not copied every time
  'precompiled' is executed.
- Fix 'kernel-precompiled' prerequisites so there is no unnecessary copying
  and no delete-copy cycle for all libs.
- Fix package contents which are currently different from SVN:
  $ svn -q status packages
  M      packages/spindown-cgi-0.1/root/usr/lib/cgi-bin/spindown.cgi
  M      packages/spindown-cgi-0.1/root/etc/default.spindown/spindown.cfg
  M      packages/syslogd-cgi-0.2.2/root/etc/init.d/rc.syslogd
  M      packages/netsnmp-5.1.2/root/etc/init.d/rc.netsnmp
  M      packages/dropbear-0.49/root/etc/init.d/rc.dropbear
- Fix uClibc rebuild after 'toolchain-clean' (symbolic links cannot be created
  because they already exist) by either prepending the actions with '-' or using
  'ln -s -f' (force). Maybe a third solution is even better: create a
  'uclibc-clean' target
- Create clean, dirclean, distclean, uninstall targets for toolchain elements
- Open question: Why do we have libjpeg if it is not used by any package?
- Integrate inetd stuff
- Perhaps integrate build option to replace AVM websrv by Busybox httpd (remove
  websrv from firmware, patch start script for AVM UI so as to use httpd).
