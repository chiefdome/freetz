To-do list for ds26
===================

$Id$

- Integrate kriegaex's boot analysis tool (log all file accesses using
  inotify-tools)
- Make ccache build script aware of gcc version change (needs rebuild in that
  case)
- Open question: Why do we have libjpeg if it is not used by any package?
  Answer (by olistudent): SANE seems to need it, but the scanners do not run
  because AVM have not finished their USB driver yet. We should check new
  packages to see if they ever provide a working version.
- Perhaps integrate build option to replace AVM websrv by Busybox httpd (remove
  websrv from firmware, patch start script for AVM UI so as to use httpd).
- Experiment with and possibly use dietlibc to create smaller binaries by
  statically compiling in stuff usually dynamically linked to uClibc.
- Add libthread_db to download toolchain (and UCLIBC_FILES)
- Either add (and maintain) a second package for openvpn without LZO or remove
  the option from menuconfig, so LZO is always used.
- Determine the best way to include rpath, i.e. something like
  export LD_RUN_PATH=/mod/lib:/lib:/usr/lib
  into makefile(s). It should be applied to all binaries for the target
  system, but not to tools and toolchain binaries.
