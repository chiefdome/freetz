To-do list for ds26
===================

$Id$

- Integrate + test httpd patch from busybox mailing list (rev. 468, testing is to be done)
- Integrate kriegaex's boot analysis tool (log all file accesses using
  inotify-tools)
- Make ccache build script aware of gcc version change (needs rebuild in that
  case)
- Fix libgcc_s build prerequisites, so it is not copied every time
  'precompiled' is executed. (rev. 467,481, requisites?)
- Fix 'kernel-precompiled' prerequisites so there is no unnecessary copying
  and no delete-copy cycle for all libs. (rev. 474, todo: clean-targets?)
- Create clean, dirclean, distclean, uninstall targets for toolchain elements
- Open question: Why do we have libjpeg if it is not used by any package?
- Integrate inetd stuff (#487-489)
- busybox builds again and again since inted patch
- Perhaps integrate build option to replace AVM websrv by Busybox httpd (remove
  websrv from firmware, patch start script for AVM UI so as to use httpd).
- Experiment with and possibly use dietlibc to create smaller binaries by
  statically compiling in stuff usually dynamically linked to uClibc.
