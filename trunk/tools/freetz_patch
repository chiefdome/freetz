# Freetz patch tool with optional auto-fix feature
#
# This script can either be dot-included via '. tools/freetz_patch' to get an
# in-process definition of the 'modpatch' shell function or executed directly.
# The execution mode will be determined by checking if $0 has the base name
# 'freetz_patch'.
#
# The functionality has evolved from the original "modpatch" function in
# Freetz's 'fwmod' script (cf. copyright information there).
# The additional auto-fix feature for self-healing patches was developed by
# Alexander Kriegisch (kriegaex), 2007-06-25.
# MD5 extension added by cuma, 2011

$freetz_patch_name - Freetz patch tool with optional auto-fix feature

Usage: $freetz_patch_name <target-dir> <patch-file|md5-dir> [md5-source]
    target-dir   - target directory to apply patch to
    patch-file   - patch file name (unified context diff, patch level -p0)
    md5-dir      - directory with patch files, named "*<MD5>*.patch"
    md5-source   - from which file md5 is computed (optional)
	               if this is not set, the first file in .patch is used

Examples:
    $freetz_patch_name source/my-package patches/my.patch
    $freetz_patch_name another/package another.patch 2
    $freetz_patch_name third/package patches-directory/
    $freetz_patch_name fourth/package patches-directory/ somewhere/file_for_md5

Environment variables changing behaviour:
    FREETZ_VERBOSITY_LEVEL  - verbose output, if >= 2
    VERBOSE                 - verbose output, if == '-v'
    AUTO_FIX_PATCHES        - try to auto-fix fuzzy non-md5 patches, if == 'y'
