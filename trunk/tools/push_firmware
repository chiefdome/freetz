# Cygwin users note:
#   1. There is NO guarantee whatsoever that this will work on Cygwin, even
#      though it does on my box (kriegaex). Provided as is.
#   2. For FTP you need the 'ncftp' cygwin package (category 'net').
#   3. You need the 'ping' command from Windows (tested on XP), NOT from the
#      'ping' cygwin package (please uninstall or change path so Windows
#      version is found first), because the cygwin version has no timeout
#      parameter as of today (2007-07-11).
#   4. For 'hexdump' you need the 'util-linux' cygwin package (category
#      'utils').
